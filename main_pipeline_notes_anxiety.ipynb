the cervical spine. within the thoracic spine, there are metastatic lesions involving the posterior vertebral body and the posterior elements at t7 and t8. there is substantial epidural disease at t7 which encases and displaces the cord anteriorly with mild compression. there is no abnormal cord signal at this time. there is a metastatic lesion involving the t5 vertebral body on the right. bilateral pleural effusions are seen. evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates multilevel spondylosis. no definite metastatic lesions seen. left kidney is not visualized and may have been surgically removed. please clinically correlate. impression: metastatic disease at t5, t7 and t8. there is epidural tumor at t7 which encases the cord and causes mild cord compression. tte ___: the left atrium is mildly dilated. no atrial septal defect is seen by 2d or color doppler. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. there is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and infero-lateral akinesis (ef 55%). no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. there is no ventricular septal defect. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. mri head/brain ___: no evidence of metastatic disease in the brain. no acute cranial process is seen. ct abd/pelvis ___ (prelim): no evidence of local disease recurrence or distant metastasis. large stool in the rectosigmoid region. brief hospital course: 1. ams: per discussion with daughter, patient has had progressive dementia for months, although daughter was not present to comment on deviation from baseline. her superimposed delirium and agitation were likely from benzo withdrawal, as she was not initially continued on her outpatient standing lorazepam (med list wasn't yet available). with addition of this, and 1mg po haldol at night, she continued to be confused, although was much more calm and had no further agitation. her delirium was also managed with pain control (she had very little pain during the admission, though) and frequent reorientation and reassurance. infectious workup was negative. she had a brain mri to rule out cva or metastatic disease, and this was negative. 2. lytic spine lesion: seen in t5, t7, t8. also seen was a mass surrounding the spinal cord with mild anterior spinal cord compression, although with a normal neuro exam. she underwent 3 sessions of xrt during this admission, and will continue xrt on ___ and ___ at 2pm to complete a total of 5 sessions. it remains unclear if her lesions are metastatic renal carcinoma or a new primary, as her renal cell cancer was last treated ___ years ago. ct abdomen/pelvis was done to search for a primary, or find a site amenable to biopsy as xrt made vertebral biopsy not possible. tumor markers were also sent, but not suggestive of a specific diagnosis. after discussion with the patient's daughter ___ (to whom the patient deferred all medical decisions due to her confusion), it was decided that no further workup for a primary site would be performed. also, it was decided that there would be no further attempts at treating the patient's malignancy at this time. the patient was on dexamethasone, along with insulin sliding scale and bactrim for prophylaxis, during this admission. she was discharged on a dexamethasone taper, and the bactrim and insulin can be stopped once she is off steroids. please continue the taper through ___ as outlined explicitly in her discharge medication list. taper may be modified further upon follow up with radiation-oncology. 3. disposition: the patient is to return to her prior skilled nursing facility. her other multiple chronic medical problems remained stable and her prior medication regimen was continued. regarding goals of care, the patient's daughter was clear that her mother would not want aggressive cancer treatments. she will complete her current radiation course and there is no plan for further treatment of her malignancy. however, she would be amenable to rehospitalization and reconsideration of treatment options if an acute problem were to develop. patient's code status is dnr/dni. medications on

___ for new flare) who came to the ed for abdominal pain since the morning of ___ concerning for acute-on-chronic ___ flare, found to have colitis on ct and leukocytosis to 27, and admitted for workup and iv antibiotics. gi was consulted and followed the patient throughout the hospitalization. it was believed the abdominal pain came about secondary to constipation and abdominal distention. the patient was given an aggressive bowel regimen, which helped the symptoms which we believe were secondary to a previous botox injection for pelvic floor disfunction. the patient also received her second loading dose of humira while in the hospital and was started on a course of steroids (initially iv to po prednisone). her abdominal pain and distension continued to improve and was at baseline at discharge. throughout the hospitalization, the patient also had continued hypoxia, which was something she had experienced at a recent hospitalization at ___, but without any clear reason. the patient required ___ of oxygen for the first half of her stay to remain in the low ___ on her o2 stat and would desat into the high ___ and low ___ during ambulation. outside records could not be gathered regarding any hypoxia. it was believe this was caused by a raised right hemidiaphragm causing low lung volumes, atlectosis from laying in bed, and blunting secondary to abdominal pain. the patient was also found to have a pneumonia (cap) which was treated for 5 days with levaquin. ultimately, once the patient began ambulating and her abdominal pain improved she was able to come of all o2 without difficulty and did not require home oxygen. the patient was also found to have leukocytosis on admission which reached a nadir of 10 during the middle of the hospitalization when the patient felt well, however began to rise without a clear cause. the wbc went up to 23.9 and stabilized around this value, and although the patient had been started on steroids, was a suspicious rise in the context of her clinical picture. a blood smear was obtained which showed inflammation, b12 deficiency, and some questionable mds type cells. the patients b12 was found to be low at 224, but an mma was not obtained as it an outpatient lab. to evaluate for other potential causes of leukocytosis, a ct abdomin/pelvis was done to evaluate for potential abscess/occult infection, and revealed a wedge-shaped infarct in a peripheral region of her liver. to further classify this and to look for any local process which could have contributed, a mri liver was done which did not demonstrate the lesion and heme/onc did not recommend anticoagulation. the patient was discharged home in stable condition. ======================= transitional issues: ======================= []check cbc in 1 week

the brain is blocked by a clot. the brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. in order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. your risk factors are: high blood pressure high cholesterol we are changing your medications as follows: - aspirin 81 mg daily (for stroke prevention) - clopidegrel (plavix) 75mg daily (for stroke prevention) - ezetimibe (zetia) 10mg daily (for cholesterol) please take your other medications as prescribed. please follow up with neurology and your primary care physician as listed below. if you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling emergency medical services (dialing 911). in particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - sudden partial or complete loss of vision - sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - sudden weakness of one side of the body - sudden drooping of one side of the face - sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body sincerely, your ___

suicide attempts, history of trauma/abuse, impulsive tendencies modifiable risk factors include: -active polysubstance misuse, acute major mood episode, social stressors in terms of housing. we modified this risk by helping patient to set up methadone program and encouraging patient to talk to outpatient providers about her opioid addiction. protective factors include: -protective factors include current outpatient providers/treatment, strong connections to family and community support, and skills in problem solving. current risk is low/moderate for intentional self-harm given that pt denies suicidal ideation, intent and plan, is accepting of treatment, is currently sober and is future oriented with plans to enroll in the methadone program, find her own housing and possibly go back to school. informed consent i discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of this medication, and risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including

neoplasm, or mass effect as cause of patient's headache and left arm and leg paresthesias. mri of the c-spine notable for mild-to-moderate canal narrowing at c5-c6, which may have contributed to headache and sensory symptoms. lumbar puncture accordingly did not show signs of inflammation or infection. patient's symptoms responded to management with fioricet, and recommendations were made to use a soft cervical collar at bedtime; gabapentin was also initiated to relieve paresthesias, with plan for titration by patient's outpatient neurologist. fioricet was prescribed for as-needed use in the interim. 2. post-dural puncture headache versus spontaneous intracranial hypotension: following patient's lumbar puncture, she reported new retro-orbital headaches that were relieved while supine and exacerbated while sitting, suggestive of post-dural puncture headache. these episodes were also associated with nausea. beacuse there also had been a postural component to her headaches before admission (improved with lying down), it was uncertain if she had spontaneous intracranial hypotension that coincidentally worsened after the lp, or if this was a post-lp ha (or possibly both). patient underwent placement of an epidural blood patch by anesthesia for relief of her symptoms. if further ___ with the pain center is required, an appointment may be scheduled with the ___ by

were admitted to ___ for evaluation of headaches and right arm pain and tingling. an mri of your brain did not show any concerning findings, and a lumbar puncture did not show signs of inflammation of the nervous system. an mri of your neck showed mild narrowing of the area around your spinal cord, which may be responsible for your arm and leg symptoms. your headache may also have been due to this narrowing. to help with your headache, you may use a soft cervical collar at nighttime. you were also prescribed a medication (gabapentin) to take at night to help with your arm and leg pain and tingling. you also received a prescription for fioricet, a medication that you can take occasionally to stop severe headaches. aside from your spine narrowing, you also experienced a different headache and nausea that was likely related to your lumbar puncture. a blood patch was placed by anesthesiology to help relieve the fluid leakage that led to this headache. you received a prescription for a nausea medication (ondansetron) to take if needed. please follow up with dr. ___ at your ___ appointment listed below. it was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. sincerely, neurology at ___

allergies / adverse drug reactions attending: ___. chief complaint: right arm movement, facial twitching, stuttering speech. major surgical or invasive procedure: none. history of present illness: the patient is a ___ year-old left-handed woman with history of migraine, gastritis, chronic constipation and recent admission to the neurology service for headache and right arm parasthesias and pain attributed to cervicogenic headache, following an extensive workup, who presents today with 2 day history of a constellation of symptoms, including worsening headache, right facial spasms, right arm tremors, and increased emotional lability. history provided by patient, husband and sister at the bedside, as well as review of records. ms. ___ was recently hospitalized ___ on the neurology service with a 5 day history of fluctuating headache, lightheadedness, intermittent blurry vision and right arm pain and parasthesias. she had an extensive workup. this included cta and mri of the brain w/ and w/o contrast which were unremarkable, with no evidence of infarct, neoplasm, or mass effect. mri c-spine notable for mild-to-moderate canal narrowing at c5-c6, which may have contributed to headache and sensory symptoms. lumbar puncture on ___ was unremarkable (wbc 1, rbc 0, total protein 20, glucose 57, ms profile with no oligoclonal bands, csf gram stain and culture negative). following the lp there was concern for post-dural puncture headache versus spontaneous intracranial hypotension, as she reported new retro-orbital headaches that were relieved while supine and exacerbated while sitting, suggestive of post-dural puncture headache. these episodes were also associated with nausea. given that there also had been a postural component to her headaches before admission (improved with lying down), it was uncertain if she had spontaneous intracranial hypotension that coincidentally worsened after the lp, or if this was a post-lp ha (or possibly both). patient underwent placement of an epidural blood patch by anesthesia for relief of her symptoms. by the time of discharge, her symptoms responded to management with fioricet, and recommendations were made to use a soft cervical collar at bedtime; gabapentin was also initiated to relieve paresthesias, with plan for titration by patient's outpatient neurologist. fioricet was prescribed for as-needed use in the interim, which patient has been taking since discharge as prescribed. since discharge on ___, patient has had a constellation of neurologic symptoms. on ___, in the evening following discharge, she reported an ongoing headache, consistent with her semiology described during admission. it was severe, but improved after taking her gabapentin and fiorcet, and she was able to sleep through the night. on that evening, however, she did find out the unfortunate news that a family friend had passed away (her aunt's daughter), whom ms. ___ was very close to. this family friend had been ill for some time, so the death was not unexpected. however, it was especially distressing to her because her aunt did not contact anyone about the death, and she felt like it was being concealed. when the patient woke up on ___, her headache head improved. her husband notes that her walk was somewhat unsteady at that time but the patient denied it, and was still able to walk household distances without falling or needing to hold onto objects. in the late afternoon, she began to have several new issues: 1) episodes of right arm tremor and higher amplitude movements. her husband recorded this on video, which i reviewed. it consisted of non-rhythmic movements of the right arm, irregular in frequency, with maintained alertness. at times it appeared more like a right arm tremor and at other times it was more like nonrhythmic shaking. patient reports that during this event, she was fully alert and aware of her arm doing it. she could suppress the movements somewhat if she concentrated, and her sister could suppress them with touching. duration lasted anywhere from a few minutes to 10 minutes or more. she had several episodes of this over the course of the evening. 2) episodes of right face \"spasm.\" also recorded on video, this consisted of twitching of the right lower face, intermixed with puckering of the lip. this appears somewhat like right hemifacial spasm versus tardative dyskinesias (though it only affects the right side of the face). as with episode #1 above, could last anywhere from a few minutes to 10 minutes or more. 3) episodes of \"word finding\" difficulty. patient had periods when she seemed to have difficulty expressing herself, lasting for only a few seconds at a time (never more than this). for example, when her husband asked her if she wanted to go outside to get some fresh air, she said \"lets go oo--\" and unable to finish saying \"out.\" they cannot think of any other examples of this. she had no difficulties understanding speech and still could express a few words. sometimes when she seemed to think of a word, her eyes would \"roll back\" for a second or two. she otherwise was at her baseline. she contacted her dr. ___ who recommended that she return to the emergency department for further evaluation, but patient declined. as these events occurred overnight, the patient woke up today (___) with no further episodes of semiologies 1 and 2. she woke up and her headache had resumed. she went to lie down and took a nap until 1:30pm. when she woke up at 1:30pm, she reported feeling \"a heavy depression.\" she said she felt sad, though not at any one particular thing, which her husband says is typical for her. she did not mention anything about the recent passing of the family friend. she called her husband on the phone (who works as a ___ and was at work) and appeared \"emotionally labile.\" husband notes that she would alternate between having a \"baby voice\" and seeming juvenile, to crying and shouting. she was making sense while talking, and discussed her headaches. he was concerned and soon went back home, where he found her sitting on the swing, talking to ems. currently, patient reports she feels back to her baseline apart from ___ headache, and is anxious to be discharged from ed to go back home. her husband notes that she still is off from her baseline, intermittently with emotional lability and \"not quite with it.\" past medical history: cervicogenic headaches s/p recent epidural patch for ?spinal headache gastritis chronic constipation social

nmda receptor ab, csf-pnd ct head w/o contrast no acute intracranial abnormalities. however, please note that acute ischemic changes are better detected on mri. brief hospital course: 1. unspecified mood disorder: patient and her husband noted a constellation of symptoms, including suppressible, non-rhythmic movements of the right upper extremity, intermittent voluntary right-sided facial grimacing, and intermittent speech, all captured on video. these findings were not clearly stereotyped, not associated with a change in mental status, and not associated with a post-ictal state, with no clear metabolic, infectious, or ischemic processes noted on testing and imaging, together reducing suspicion for seizures. given onset of symptoms two days prior to presentation, the absence of ischemia on non-contrast head ct also argued against new infarct as contributor to patient's symptoms, particularly in light of negative brain mri with and without contrast less than a week prior to presentation. given patient's recent headaches and behavioral change, an autoimmune encephalitis panel (in addition to a paraneoplastic panel) were requested from csf obtained during the most recent admission. given the absence of a convincing neurologic etiology for patient's symptoms, patient was evaluated by the psychiatry service, who suspected an unspecified mood disorder or possible panic disorder; consideration was also given to underlying conversion disorder or histrionic personality disorder. recommendations included discontinuation of gabapentin, initiation of clonazepam as bridging therapy to outpatient psychiatric care, and referral for an outpatient psychiatric provider. a referral number was provided to the patient for an outpatient psychiatry np with intake planned for within one week of discharge. in addition to the above changes, as-needed sumatriptan was prescribed for migraine headaches, with as-needed lorazepam for severe panic episodes not responding to reassurance and redirection (which patient's husband and family have been comfortably able to provide at home). as noted above, these medications will need to be reviewed by patient's outpatient

instructions: dear ms. ___, you were admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit on deaconess 4 for depressed mood and passive suicidality while withdrawing from wellbutrin (bupropion) and lexapro (escitalopram). we put you back on these medications, though we had to restart the lexapro at a lower dose since you had been off of it for a week and a half (when there is no lexapro in your system, you must start at a lower dose and gradually build up to the target dose). so for one more week, please take two 10mg tablets daily (total daily dose of 20mg). after that, please take three 10mg tablets daily for a total daily dose of 30mg. you will continue with your wellbutrin (bupropion) extended release as you were taking it previously (300mg once daily). we did discontinue your adderall for now. this drug can be dangerous when depression is not optimally controlled with medications. you may be able to go back on it soon (after you leave the hospital) but doing so under the supervision of your new outpatient psychiatrist would be optimal. we have scheduled appointments with outpatient psychiatry; please see below for full details. please do not hesitate to return to the

emotions. she would be extremely elated, affectionate, and excited one minutes, and a few minutes later, she would be somnolent and tearful.\" she described this behavior secondary to social/familial stressors. mother commented that this behavior has been present patient's entire life; denies that this mood lability was new upon entry to high school. mother commented that patient had difficulty

the lungs are well expanded; however, there is minimal bibasilar atelectasis evident. the mediastinum is unremarkable. the cardiac silhouette is stable, accounting for patient and technical factors. no effusion or pneumothorax is evident. the visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. . ___ u/s ___ findings: this was a limited doppler evaluation of the tips stent. again demonstrated in the right hepatic lobe is a tips stent catheter, which appears unchanged in position. color doppler evaluation shows wall-to-wall color doppler signal within the tips stent. flow velocities within the tips stent in the proximal, mid, and distal portions are 127, 173, and 175 cm/sec respectively. overall, these are in similar range to the prior studies of ___ and ___. there is appropriate hepatopetal blood flow in the main portal vein. as before, no definite flow is identified within the left portal vein. impression: patent tips stent with flow velocities within similar range to recent evaluations. . small bowel follow-through ___: no evidence of mechanical obstruction. fecalization of the small bowel consistent with slowly resolving small bowel obstruction. small bowel fold thickening likely related to resolving obstruction and chronic liver disease. r heart cath ___: 1. normal right sided filling pressures. 2. mild pulmonary artery hypertension. 3. preservec cardiac index. . echo ___: the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. there is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is no pericardial effusion. ef 40-45%, diastolic dysfunction. . eeg ___: markedly abnormal portable eeg due to the low voltage slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing. these findings indicate a moderately severe encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical functions. medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes. there were no areas of prominent focal abnormalities, and there were no epileptiform features. . egd ___ varices at the lower third of the esophagus grade 3 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction (biopsy) food in the whole stomach granularity, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy . ___ liver biopsy: 1. focal, mild portal and minimal lobular, predominantly mononuclear inflammation with admixed eosinophils and a rare neutrophil. 2. a rare portal, non-necrotizing granuloma identified. 3. bile ducts with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized. 4. no steatosis or intracytoplasmic hyalin. 5. mild increased portal fibrosis with foci of sinusoidal fibrosis on trichrome stain (interpreted as stage 1 fibrosis). 6. no iron deposition on iron stain. note: the features are consistent with involvement by the patient's previously diagnosed hepatic sarcoidosis. the presence of focal sinusoidal fibrosis raises the possibility of a prior toxic/metabolic injury. a reticulin stain will be performed and the results reported in an addendum. . brief hospital course: ms. ___ is a ___ w/ esld most likely from sarcoid s/p tips, severe portal gastropathy, grade ii esoph varices, cardiomyopathy w/ ef 40% and diastolic dysfunction admitted to micu for ams ___ likely hepatic encephalopathy and possible med non-compliance, treated with lactulose with marked improvement. 1) altered mental status: extensive possible differential diagnosis but most likely etiology is continued suboptimal lactulose compliance vs subtherapeutic lactulose dose at home and resulting hepatic encephalopathy. this is especially likely given her improving mental status after only 2 doses of lactulose. cxr w/o pathology, pt remained afebrile with mild left shift, u/a without e/o infection. sbp unlikely given no abdominal symptoms and minimal ascites. recurrent hospitalizations after her tips procedure also indicate tips may be cause of her worsening encephalopathy. she was evaluated by interventional radiology for a tips reduction however the procedure was not completed as there was good portal flow across the liver. she did have a transjugular liver biopsy by ___, results were pending at time of discharge. she will follow up with dr. ___ in clinic. 2) anemia: baseline hct low ___. she has significant bleeding risks from varices, gastropathy and colonic/gastric avms and is likely slowly oozing. she has required transfusions in past however did not require transfusion during this admission. guaiac negative stools in-house, no e/o hematemesis or hematochezia at this time. she was continued on nadolol and lactulose. hematocrit was 32.2 on discharge. 3) sarcoidosis: liver and pulmonary involvement resulting in pulmonary hypertension and varices. complicated by several variceal bleeds resulting in tips placement. she was continued on her home prednisone dosage. 4) portal hypertension and gastropathy: secondary to sarcoidosis as above and resulting in tips placement. she continued her ppi and nadolol. 5)partial small-bowel obstruction: pt with normal small bowel follow-through ___ and had several episodes of vomiting and abdominal x-ray showed evidence of small-bowel obstruction which resolved with bowel regimen. she continued to take po's without problem and was having ___ bowel movements per day and was free of abdominal pain/nausea on discharge. she was given a rx for enemas which she can use if she is constipated despite taking lactulose as this worked well for her during her hospitalization. 6) chf: chronic stable moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be related to her sarcoidosis. no current signs of fluid overload on exam as basilar crackles likely ___ atelectasis. 7) copd: pfts stable over past ___ years and not requiring home oxygen therapy. she received prn nebulizer treatments. 8) hypothyroidism: continue synthroid 9) h/o rsd s/p

who presents with somnolence. 1 somnolence: likely exacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy given her history and rapidity of improvement although it is unclear why this would have been exacerbated. she states compliance with medications, though has had difficulty with noncompliance in the past. discussion with her husband reveals that she has been taking lactulose once daily and perhaps this is not sufficient for her. there was no evidence of tips obstruction on u/s. no ascites to tap for sbp. hct stable and no brbrp or evidence of gib given guaiac negative. no fevers, dysuria, or abdominal pain to suggest infectious source. on admission she did have acute renal failure that appeared related to diuretic use, that may have contributed. u tox/serum tox negative. she readily improved with increased lactulose administration. she was continued on flagyl, thiamine and folic acid as well. 2 acute renal failure: creatinine was elevated to 1.4 from baseline 0.9 on admission. this was thought possibly secondary to diuretic use (spironolactone and lasix) and supported by feurea that was prerenal. the diuretics were held and she was given gentle ivf and her renal failure improved. she was started on lower doses of spironolactone and lasix on discharge, and was ordered for repeat renal function and electrolytes for 5 days after discharge. 3 sarcoidosis: liver and pulmonary involvement resulting in pulmonary hypertension, cirrhosis and varices. she was continued on home prednisone. 4 ecg changes: minimally changed from baseline ekg. completely asymptomatic, low suspicion for acs or demand ischemia. she completed a rule out by cardiac enzymes, which were negative and she was monitored on telemetry with no events during this. 5 congestive heart failure: chronic stable moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be related to her sarcoidosis. no symptoms or signs of fluid overload were noted during her hospital course. it was noted that she was on diltiazem on admission, started by her primary care physician for unclear reasons so this was stopped and she was discharged off this medication. 6 copd: pfts stable, she was

changes in the lungs consistent with stated diagnosis of copd. cxr (___): impression: atelectasis left lower lobe. cxr (___): findings: in comparison with the study earlier in this date, there is some prominence of interstitial markings with kerley lines, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. poor definition of the retrocardiac region raises the possibility of some atelectatic change at the base. blunting of the costophrenic angles could be a manifestation of pleural fluid. cxr (___): findings: in comparison with the sequence of previous films from earlier in this month, there has been clearing of the left pleural effusion. cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. prominence of interstitial markings may reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both. no acute focal pneumonia. brief hospital course: 1) small bowel obstruction  ct from ___ showed a transition point in the mid-distal ileum and no ascites. surgery was consulted and an ng was placed with return of 1.5l of bilious fluid. sbo thought to be likely due to adhesions, possibly related to sarcoidosis. she was intubated for airway protection and a left subclavian cvc was placed for access. the ng tube had >1l output for first ___ days. output then decreased and stools picked up so the ng tube was removed. she was extubated on ___ and had a picc placed for tpn on ___. her diet was slowly advanced and the tpn was weaned. at discharge she was tolerating a regular diet and was moving her bowels. 2) anemia  acute normocytic anemia. initial hematocrit of 41 was likely due

prbcs on ___ and about 1 hour later developed acute pulmonary edema with sbp 200 and hr 130. she received lasix 40mg iv and her symptoms and vitals rapidly improved with a 1l output. the blood bank was notified due to the possiblity of trali. her hematocrit rise was appropriate and remained in the mid ___. 3) hepatic sarcoidosis: complicated by recurrent encephalopathy, patient status post tips and revision. her platelets remained stable with negative hit antibodies. her encephalopathy improved rapidly following lactulose. her tips was found to be occluded, but revision was not done due to concern that it would worsen her encephalopathy. she also initially received empiric flagyl to prevent bacterial translocation, but this was deemed unnecessary and discontinued. she was continued on her home ursodiol, ppi, and vitamins/minerals. she was initially on hydrocortisone while npo, but switched to her outpatient prednisone before discharge. she was also restarted on her sucralfate, furosemide, and spironolactone at discharge. her amitriptyline and zolpidem were held due to her encephalopathy and may be restarted as an outpatient if appropriate. 3) pneumonia  on ___, she spiked to 101.7 and there was concern for an infiltrate on cxr. etiology aspiration versus vap. she was started on vanc/zosyn, narrowed to zosyn, and was subsequently afebrile and without leukocytosis. she completed a 7 day course of antibiotics prior to discharge. 4) arf  her bun and cr were elevated on admission to 46 and 2.2, respectively, up from baseline bun ___ and baseline cr 0.8-1.0. she was given iv lr for prerenal azotemia and her furosemide and spironolactone were held. she was also noted to have a gbs uti and was orinigally given pen g, but it was determined that the zosyn (see above)

summarized by surgical and medical services mrs. ___ is a ___ yo female with with history of elsd from hepatic sarcoid who initially presented on ___ w/ small bowel obstruction and had hospital course complicated by arf, status epilepticus, secondary bacterial peritonitis, and hepatic encephalopathy. brief hospital course by problem small bowel obstruction the patient was admitted to ___ with nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. given her history of hepatic sarcoidsis, the patient underwent ct of abd/pelvis revealing a transition point in rlq pelvis with fecalization of sb proximal to this pt. of note, prior ct on ___ had revealed cirrhosis and portal htn with tips shunt occluded. the patient was thus taken to the or on ___ where she underwent exploratory laparotomy with enterotomy and lysis of adhesions. intraoperatively she was found to have some adhesions with dilated loops of bowel but no transition point; the small bowel was dilated to the extent that an enterotomy was required in order to decompress the bowel and close the abdomen. she also had a cvl placed in the or. she was kept intubated overnight and brought to the icu. she was weaned to extubated in the am. she received perioperative antibiotics and stress dose steroids postoperatively. esophageal varices/anemia/portal gastropathy she also had an egd on ___ that revealed 3 nonbleeding grade 2 varices in distal esophagus and portal hypertension gastritis w small blood clot in stomach; no active bleeding. she had a relatively stable anemia that trended down around ___ that was thought to be morst likely secondary to slow ooze from portal gastropathy. she was transfused 2 units prbc ___, 1 unit ___ with subsequent stabilization of hct. varices were banded on day of discharge and she was started on sucralfate for 10 days. postoperative ileus on ___ she was transferred to the floor, her ngt was discontinued, and she was started on sips, which she tolerated well. on ___ she was noticed to be increasingly tender without bowel movements; kub revealed persistent dilated small-bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels concerning for persistent small-bowel obstruction or post-operative ileus. her ngt was replaced. she was started empirically on unasyn. acute renal failure while on surgical service, the patient was also noted to have an increase in her creatinine from 1.3 to 2.2; this was thought secondary to large fluid losses from her jp drain in her abdomen; she was started on replacements ___ cc/cc with improvement in her creatinine to 1.2 on ___. she had a picc placed on ___ and was started on tpn. she again developed a rise in her creatinine on ___. she was given albumin 62.5g on ___ and bicarb and blood on ___ for volume rescusitation. urine microscopy showed granular and hyaline cast. urine lytes were not consistent with pre-renal but renal felt this was a pre-renal/evolving atn picture. she has a mixed non-gap and gap acidosis. the gap is likely from the renal failure and the non-gap from her diarrhea. the bicarb has improved her acid-base status and lactulose was stopped to slow down the diarrhea. creatinine trended down prior to discharge. diuretics were held. hepatic encephalopathy on the floor the patient was noticed to be increasingly less talkative with a dull affect, thought to be consistent with past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. she was given high dose lactulose pr with initial improvement in her mental status. secondary bacterial peritonitis the patient had been improving, and so her ngt was discontinued. unfortunately, she then developed increasing abdominal pain; on ___ she underwent repeat ct scan of abd/pelvis that revealed persistent dilation of multiple loops of small bowel with wall thickening and mesenteric edema without a definitive transition point concerning for a mixed mechanical and functional obstruction, a cirrhotic liver with tips and portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, and diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. the jp drain fluid was sent for analysis; klebsiella oxytoca and ___ grew out from the fluid both on ___ and ___. infectious disease was consulted; the patient was started on zosyn for the klebsiella and caspofungin for the ___. the zosyn was eventually changed to cefepime on ___ given the sensitivities. cefepime was later changed to meropenem due to concern for precipitating seizure. her home gabapentin and amitriptyline were held given their potential muscarinic effects on peristalsis. the patient had been having low-grade fevers in the setting of steroids but no mental status changes at the time. she was thought to have infected peritoneal fluid possibly secondary to the enterotomy, though the etiology is not completely clear. serial paracenteses were performed until pt no longer had evidence of bacterial peritonitis with <250 polys in ascitic fluid. she was continued on antibiotics for two week course after jp pulled to complete ___. the patient's abdominal exam gradually improved, her ngt was discontinued on ___, and she was started on a regular diet given that she was passing gas and having bowel movements. that said, the patient continued to have low-grade fevers throughout even though she was still on steroids (tapered to her home dose from admission) and multiple antibiotics. because of her improved exam, decreased output from her jp and the thought that her fluid status could be better managed with the drain out, her jp drain was removed. she did have some tenederness on abdominal exam on ___, and so she underwent another ct scan that revealed increased ascites compared to prior study but no focal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation. the patient did have diffuse anasarca and mesenteric edema; the small bowel was mildly dilated with mild bowel wall thickening, decreased since prior study, and there was no pneumatosis or free air. hypernatremia the patient also became hypernatremic to a high of 154 on ___ was started on free water replacements), likely intravascularly depleted given her high bun, and hyperchloremic with a low bicarbonate; the later two likely secondary to previous normal saline/tpn loads. given her stable vital signs, she was transferred to the floor on ___, though she still remains with altered mental status further discuused below. altered mental status on ___ the patient was noted to be increasingly abulic, though paranoid appearing. she was transferred to the sicu. she underwent an abd u/s on ___ that revealed scant ascites, patent vasculature, and biliary dilatation. given the results the patient did not undergo paracentesis even though this was one possible etiology for her ams. both psychiatry (who had previously been following the patient for depression) and neurology were consulted. her mental status waxed and waned with occasional episodes of increased awareness and pronouncing her name. her altered mental status was initially thought to be due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy ___ liver disease, infection, and underlying brain disease. her eeg on ___ was consistent with this and negative for seizure per neurology although there was a questionable focus in the frontal lobe. lp and mri/a were performed and were both negative on ___. ng tube was pulled out on ___ and put back in ___ and patient was treated with lactulose with stool outputs of a liter per day. patient had paracentesis ___ with reduction in white cells but persistent bacterial peritonitis and gram negative rods on gram stain. on ___, per id, metronidazole was added to cover anerobes. patient had been on cefepime for klebsiella and caspofungin for ___ ___ since her initial tap. she completed 2 week course (after jp pulled) with change of antibiotics to meropenem (then ertapenem at discharge for once daily dosing) and caspo. status epilepticus on the morning of ___ she was noted to be \"twitching\". her glucose and electrolytes were wnl. neurology was contacted and initially did not think this was seizure activity but eeg was ordered to r/o myoclonic seizure. eeg demonstrated status epilepticus. she was given 2 mg iv ativan and this resolved. she was loaded with fosphenytoin and continued on fosphenytoin with daily monitoring of levels. it was unclear what precipitaed seizures but may have been form underlying brain disease (h/o cva), hepatic encephalopathy, or med effect. flagyl was discontinued and cefeoime changed to ___. she was transferred to micu fo closer monitoring. ekg and cxr were wnl during this episode. when her mental status remained altered after being on therapeutic dilantin, she was started on keppra in addition to dilantin. mental status subsequently continued to improve and she became awake, oriented and conversant. she was started on a regular diet and started working with physical therapy and was discharged to home with services. hypothyroidism continued on levothroxine. tsh wnl. code full medications on admission: albuterol

the icu. a chest xray showed a new lll infiltrate, which likely represented pneumonitis in response to her aspiration. at the same time, she is at risk for gram-negative infections given her recent hospitalizations. she was started on vancomycin and zosyn given this risk for pneumonia. she was given 5 liters of normal saline for hypotension and briefly required levophed, likely in the setting of propofol sedation. on ___, she underwent ___ placement of a post-pyloric dobhoff for tube feeds and an ng tube for suction/decompression. a repeat kub was obtained, which was unchanged from ___, thereby decreasing suspicion for small bowel obstruction. she also underwent bronchoscopy, which showed largely normal anatomy, and bal which was sent for gram stain/culture. sputum gram stain showed 25+ polys and 2+ yeast. following bromchoscopy, sedation was weaned, and the patient had an excellent spontaneous breathing trial. she was extubated, and was maintaining good oxygen saturation on nasal cannula and was normotensive. . 2. fever. the patient was febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. differential includes pneumonia, infectious diarrhea, uti, line infection. infectious workup, including c. diff, was negative for diarrhea, and patient had no stools when tfs were stopped. per gi, the patient has a combination of gastric dysmotility and intestinal hypermobility, which is likely the cause of her diarrhea. also has had cvl for 6 days so line infection is a consideration. plan to d/c cvl when extubated and hemodynamically stable. blood and urine cultures were also sent, and showed no growth. the patient was also given stress dose steroids. 3. diarrhea. per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days. initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac negative. tube feeds held. lactulose and rifaximin continued. infectious stool studies negative. . 4. gi dysmotility. history of sbos and psbos s/p multiple ex-laps in past. initially felt to have

post-pyloric dobhoff were placed as above. there was not resolution on ___ the patient was taken to the or by dr ___ for lysis of adhesions as sbo was not resolving with return of gi function. several enterotomies were made and an ostomy was created in the r lower quadrant. this is a very large ostomy and requires special appliances. following the surgery, the ostomy started having outout within a few days. on occasion, the ostomy output was greater than 1 liter of stool, octreotide was tried with good result, and towards the end of the hospitalization, the stool has decreased significantly and the octreotide has been stopped. . 5. cirrhosis: secondary to sarcoidosis. complicated by varices, history of encephalopathy. lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, nadolol were continued, but multiple adjustments were made over the course of the hospitalization, please see the final med list for current medications. . 6. sarcoidosis: chronic issue. related to her cirrhosis. - continue steroids 7. seizures: continue phenytoin and keppra. these was some reoccurence of seizure activity while the patient was in the icu following the surgery. dosing was adjusted, continue to follow dilantin levels weekly. . 8 nutrition: initially had dobhoff placed, but secondary to bowel issues, this was stopped. patient has been followed by nutrition services with daily tpn. caloric intake toward the end of

course was protracted, below is a summary by chronological problem. # sepsis: likely sources are staph epidermidis from ___ line and vre in urine. patient initially needed low dose levophed to keep map>60 after ivf boluses, but this vasopressor was quickly weaned off. stress dose steroids were also started as the patient is chronically on prednisone 10 mg daily. these were then tapered and planned return to home dose on ___. per id, she was started on meropenem and linezolid and continued on these while in the icu. patient had vre growing at osh, as well as staph epi in the blood, but no vre or staph epi were isolated inhouse. murmur heard on exam; thus, echo completed and without vegetations. also, given multiple sbos and enterocutatneous fistula, surgery was consulted and recommended non-urgent ct scan to evaluate. ct abd/pelvis was performed to rule out perinephric abscess, which was negative for abscess or any other intrabdominal pathology. initial urinary cultures grew only yeast, so patient was treated with 3 days of fluconazole. meropenem and linezolid were changed to vancomycin only to complete a total of 8 day course of antibiotics for line sepsis. this resolved during the hospitalization # acute renal failure: per rehab notes, her cr has been increasing and lasix (home medication) had been held. cr was 1.5 on ___. renal ultrasound negative. likely elevated in setting in sepsis and hypotension. cr trended and renally dosed medications. the patient was discharged with a cr of 1.2 that was stable at 1.3 for the 10 days prior to d/c # gastroparesis: persistent nausea and vomiting. standing iv antiemetics as well as iv ativan. ngt placed on ___ for decompression and later removed by patient. no obvious sbo on abdominal ct. gradually advanced diet to soft foods and reglan, patient tolerated until aspiration on ___. this was a significant problem this hospitalization. after returning from the icu, having recovered from the sepsis, she had an aspiration event of bilious emesis. she returned to the icu, was intubated and treated for the chemical pneumonitis with coverage for aspiration pna. she return to the floor with an uncompromised respiratory status. on the floor, she continued to have intermittent episodes of emesis. during one episode 5 days prior to d/c, an ngt was placed. ultimately, it fell out and the pt reufsed all further ngt placement. she was started on cisapride and these gradually faded with resolution by the time of d/c # ostomy output: had large quantity of secretory ostomy output. improvement after octreotide and tincture of opium added. nevertheless, this was a serious problem this hospitalization. it was managed with octreotide until the pt refused that medication ___ the pain of injection and cholestyramine. we replaced lost fluids with ns and tpn. # urinary tract infection: had klebsiella in urine and received meropenem and then bactrim for a total 6 day course of antibiotic treatment. # history of seizures: continued keppra and dilantin. secondary to gastroparesis and malabsorption, she requires the phenytoin suspension formula. ___ to n/v the pt was discharged on iv keppra and phosphenytoin. # liver failure from sarcoidosis: s/p tips and tips revision, most recent egd ___ w/ esophagitis (on ppi) but no varicies or portal gastropathy. no apparent history of sbp. on transplant list. no history of cirrhosis. # itching - the pt has progressive, intractable pruritis likely ___ tpn cholestasis. this was managed with creams, cholestyramine, rifampin and naltrexone. only the naltrexone worked, so that was what she was d/c'd on. # gi bleed - the pt became to bleed, first with emesis on ___ and then from the ostomy on ___. the bleed was brisk and red followed by melanotic. she was transfused with three units. the pt consented to endoscopy but no bleed was found. still, the pt and the family agreed that her wishes were to go home regardless of gi bleed. # cmo/home with hospice - ultimately, the pt decided after several lengthy discussions with the hepatology teams, palliative care, social work and case management as well as the family that she would like to go home with hospice. we arranged that her treatments would all be symptom related, including itching, pain, ostomy output, seizures, gastroparesis and anxiety. she was discharged in stable

admissions for the same in which lactulose non-adherence has been suspected; this is her ___ admission with delirium secondary to hepatic encephalopathy within the last month. ms. ___ was intubated for airway protection in the ed; she was extubated without difficulty in the micu and remained stable on room air. she admits to taking less lactulose than prescribed due to diarrhea and frequent bowel movements ___ per day) several days prior to admission. hard stool was noted on rectal exam in ed, which reinforced the theory that she was non-adherent with the lactulose as prescribed. her home regimen of lactulose 30 ml po tid was restarted (with ___ bms per day) and her mental status quickly cleared. . other differential diagnosis for her delirium was considered, including infection, hypothyroidism, intoxication, and medication overdose. however, these alternate diagnoses were felt to be less likely. specifically, sbp was considered. paracentesis was not performed in the ed, and she was empirically covered with ceftriaxone for 3 days. ceftriaxone was discontinued on the day prior to discharge considering her marked clinical improvement with lactulose and the low probability of sbp. meningitis was unlikely clinically--nonelevated wbc and no systemic symptoms; she also underwent lp during late ___ for a similar presentation of delirium and the lp was negative. cxr was negative; urinalysis was negative; and wbc count was nonelevated to suggest other infection. gastrointestinal infectious workup was negative for ova and parasites in the stool, e. coli 0157:h7, and clostridium difficile x1. infectious diarrhea was unlikely as the patient was having a normal bowel movements for her level of lactulose ___ per day) upon discharge and showed no other signs of infection. . also, her altered mental status was too acute to be a typical presentation of hypothyroidism affecting the sensorium; tsh was within normal limits at the end of ___. urine/serum tox screen was negative in the ed. sedating meds including amitriptyline and gabapentin were held on presentation but were restarted once her mental status returned to baseline. . #. hepatic sarcoid/cirrhosis transaminases were stable as compared to baseline. the total bilirubin level was more elevated than previously (at 1.6 on admission) but trended downward to within-normal-limits range, 1.3 on dicharge. alkaline phosphatase was stably elevated at ~175. the patient appears chronically thrombocytopenic in low 100s but upon discharge her platelet count was 80. coagulation panel is essentially normal except for an elevated ptt, which may be more elevated than normal but could be secondary to heparin flushes/subcutaneous heparin. albumin 3.0 suggests relatively preserved synthetic hepatic function. home medications, nadolol, rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol were continued. also her patient's outpatient dose of prednisone (10 mg daily) was continued for sarcoid. . #. anemia/thrombocytopenia: her baseline hct appears to be in the high ___, low ___ she was approximately baseline on admission with a hct of 31. she has a normal mcv and relatively normal fe/folate/b12 studies; her anemia is likely anemia of chronic disease. her hematocrit trended downward to <23.5. prior to discharge, she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after consulting the liver service. she showed no evidence of hemolysis on labs (normal total bilirubin, normal haptoglobin), no evidence of gastorintestinal bleeding though she has known esophageal varices and a known colonic ateriovenous malformation. . #. cardiomyopathy her most recent ef was 40-45% (echo in ___, which was improved from 15% previously. the etiology of her cardiomyopathy was not entirely clear and has been classified as idiopathic in the past. the patient is only on a beta-blocker; she is on neither an acei nor diuretics. continued nadolol as per outpatient regimen. . #. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease she showed no signs of bronchospam throughout her hospitalization. an albuterl prn inhaler was provided. #. hypothyroidism: ___ was last checked late ___ at which time it was normal.

short gut syndrome on chronic tpn who is admitted for fevers, found to have high grade yeast fungemia. . # fungemia: most likely source is line infection secondary to chronic tpn. his picc line was pulled, the patient was started on micafungin. after 48 hours of negative cultures, a double lumen picc line was placed. infectious disease recommended a 2 week course of micafungin, with plans to follow-up sensitivities. ophthalmology did not see evidence of eye involvement, and a tte did not show evidence of endocarditis. the patient will complete a course of micafungin and at that time consideration of a tunneled line will take place. dr. ___ will work with the patient and iv team to arrange this. . # back pain: the patient did have back spasms, which was evaluated with an mri (without gadolinium as the patient could not tolerate longer in the machine). this did not show evidence of infection. he should have a repeat mri with gadolinium within two weeks of discharge. he was treated with a lidocaine patch and oxycodone . # cad: patient has likely chronic cad based on tte and ekg consistent with inferior wall hypokinesis. dr. ___ was contacted and felt the patient was ok for primary asa prophylaxis from a gastroenterology standpoint. the patient preferred to see a cardiologist as an outpatient closer to his home and not at ___. . # crohn's disease: c/b short gut syndrome. tpn held. the patient became hemoconcentrated on the day of discharge, and was given 1l ivf. plan to restart tpn with home infusion company. continued budesonide, cholestyramine, codeine, loperamide, ursodiol and vitamin d. . # ckd: remained at recent baseline cr of 1.5-1.7 . # diabetes: intially held lantus given the patient was not using tpn, however he became hyperglycemic so this was restarted. #htn: continued hydralazine, carvedilol #gerd: continued ranitidine and omeprazole #hl: continued atorvastatin 10mg daily, ezetimibe, gemfibrozil #depression: continued duloxetine

related to an infection of your picc line, and so this line was removed. you also had yeast in your blood, which likely caused the fever. we are treating you with a medicine to kill the yeast. it will be very important for you to take good care of your new picc line. this means wearing gloves, sterilizing the line before using, keeping your ostomy supplies separate from your picc line supplies, and following the instructions of the nurses who help with your tpn. this will help prevent future infections which could make you very, very sick. you also had some findings on the ultrasound of your heart and your ekg that require that you follow-up with a cardiology doctor as an outpatient. you should speak with your primary care doctor regarding this, as you may need a \"stress test\" to evaluate your heart. please note the following medication changes: -please take ranitidine, 300mg, at night (this is a change from taking 150mg in the morning and 150mg in the evening) -please start micafungin iv daily until ___. the infectious disease doctors ___ be following the data from your blood culture to make sure that this medication effectively treats your infection. if it does not, you may hear from them about starting a different medication -please start lidocaine patch for your back pain -please start aspirin once daily (81mg) for your heart -please start oxycodone for back pain. this medication can be dangerous with your fentanyl patch, and you should be very careful to not drink alcohol or drive when using this medication. if you are feeling more sleepy or confused than usual, you should also not use this medication. followup instructions: ___ </td></tr><tr><td>21921527</td><td>0</td><td> name: ___ unit no: ___ admission date: ___ discharge date: ___ date of birth:

there is no pleural effusion. pathology: diagnosis: gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies, four (a-d): 1. gastric antrum (a): chronic inactive gastritis. immunohistochemical stain for helicobacter is negative with adequate controls. 2. duodenum (b): mildly active duodenitis. 3. small bowel ulcer (c): small intestinal mucosa, within normal limits. 4. small bowel (d): duodenal mucosa within normal limits. note: no granulomata or dysplasia identified. ___: small bowel enteroscopy scattered ulcers in the ileum compatible with crohns (biopsy), mild friability and erythema in the ileum compatible with ileitis (biopsy), otherwise normal ileoscopy to ___: egd erythema and erosion in the antrum and pylorus compatible with gastritis vs crohns (biopsy) nodularity, granularity, friability and erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis (biopsy). otherwise normal egd to third part of the duodenum brief hospital course: ___ yo male with crohn's disease c/b multiple prior sbos s/p resections, ?short-gut syndrome on tpn, right picc and prior stomal bleeds who presents with 1l of bright red bloody output from ileostomy bag x 1 day, associated with heartburn, abdominal pain, and poor po intake. # gib: bright red blood could indicate upper or lower gib. given patient complaints of both heartburn and abdominal pain, he could have new or erosive ulcers from esophagus to ileum explaining his symptoms and as potential sources of bleeding. less likely etiologies include variceal bleed given no evidence of portal htn on exam with normal lfts and platelet count, although pt is at increased risk of developing tpn induced liver injury especially if crohn's disease is not better medically optimized. lgib etiologies include sb ulcer below the ligament of treitz, nsaid induced-duodenal ulcers although pt was only on asa 81 and stopped taking it in ___. his inflammatory markers were quite high indicating that he definitely has marked ongoing inflammation. pt had egd/ileoscopy which showed gastritis vs. crohn's ulcer in gastric antrum and friable ulcer in ileum c/w ileitus and biopsies were obtained. final path showed gastritis and duodenitis. h-pylori not seen on final path as well. patient was treated with methylprednisone iv and marked reduction in his pain and inflammatory markers. he was transitioned to prednisone 60mg po daily and will continue on this until follow-up with his outpatient gastroenterologist dr. ___. his diet was slowly advanced and he was tolerating po prior to discharge. # crohn's disease: symptoms returned after patient started smoking about ___ years ago. he does have chronic ileitis on biopsy and some ulcers on endoscopy, although admittedly clean based. would likely benefit from systemic therapy as a trial to see if symptoms improve and to prevent further complications. patient was seen by social work for tobacco cessation counseling. home budesonide, cholestyramine, and ursodiol were continued. hepatitis serologies, quantiferon gold, ebv and cmv were checked prior initiation of anti-tnf therapy which is planned in the near future. # anemia: ___ iron deficiency as well as anemia of chronic disease. repeat labs confirmed iron deficiency. he was restarted on iron supplimentation # high stool output with presumed short gut syndrome: pt reports having tried everything in the past w/o relief, but has not tried tincture of opium, willing to try anything. tsh wnl. stool output decreased over his hospital stay with better control of his inflammation. he was continued on mv. for nutrition his picc line was removed and central venous line was placed as it had been scheduled as an outpatient. # ___ on ckd: most likely prerenal secondary to poor po intake. he was treated with ivf and creatinine returned to baseline (~1.3). # hypoxia: unclear etiology. potentially secondary to decreased respirations/sedation from narcotics received in the ed. ibd patients have a higher risk of clot so pe must always be entertained, pt tachycardic (on beta-blockade), no reports of pleuritic cp but is c/o heartburn/reflux. cxr unremarkable, ___ was 100 2l this morning. he was monitored and o2 sats remained consistently stable and >96-97% on ra during his hospital stay. chronic issues: # t2-hypointense and hyperenhancing lesion in the left prostatic apex: seen on mre. urology was consulted and will see mr. ___ as an outpatient for further evaluation. psa was normal. # diabetes: history of chronic prednisone use in the past. glucose was elevated in setting of steroids, he was covered with sliding scale and additional insulin was added to this tpn. # vitamin d deficiency: ___ vitamin d 25-oh 18 at osh while he was on ___ iu daily . he was continued vit d 50k qweek # htn: currently normotensive - home carvedilol initially held for permissive tachycardia in setting of possible acute bleed, but was restarted when hct was stable. # hld: unclear as to why he is on this regimen and not a statin? perhaps pt had elevated lfts in setting of chronic tpn and being on statin. # anxiety/depression: continued duloxetine, held ativan # gerd: h.pylori negative recently at osh and on biopsy at ___. home ppi was held while patient was on ppi gtt. he was discharged home on pantoprazole po bid and ranitidine # fen: ivfs as above / replete lytes prn / clears # ppx: ppi drip, no hep sq given bleeding #

hco3-28 angap-12 mg-2.3, vitb12-482 folate-greater th, tsh-2.4 brief hospital course: pt is a ___ yo man w/ multiple medical and social issues who admitted with hypertensive urgency. # htn urgency: patient presented with very elevated systolic bp as in frequent prior admissions. per patient's report, he has not been taking outpatient medications, although he does not give a reason for this. he does report, however, that his girlfriend of many years recently passed away during heart surgery. he has been very sad but denies using any illicit drugs. medical regimen was restarted per last discharge summary, as patient was not sure of what he was taking. lisinopril and hctz were added to the regimen, but patient developed acute renal failure and were stopped (for details, please see below). metoprolol was added and amlodipine dose was increased. we also transitioned from oral clonidine to the clonidine patch. for full details, please see medications section. # chest pain: at time of presentation, patient complained of left sided chest pain that was dull and constant. pain was easily reproducible to palpation and was not associated with any diaphoresis, nausea or lightheadedness. cardiac enzymes were obtained and negative times three and no ecg changes were see on serial tracings. cta of the chest performed as patient had history of pulmonary emboli, which did not find any new lesions or evidence of aortic dissection. patient was started on a beta blocker and continued on aspirin per outpatient regimen. although this presentation was not suggestive of acs or ischemia, history suggestive of underlying cad with last stress test performed in ___. due to poor adherence, we considered inpatient stress testing. because patient has chronic back pain / musculoskeletal pain, excercise stress test was not feasible. persatine mibi test was ordered, however patient exhibited bronchospasm requiring escalation of copd regimen before test could be performed. will defer further testing to outpatient setting. # blurry/double vision/ headache: at time of presentation, patient was uncooperative with history and gave vague report of vision problems. mri of the brain was offered but declined by the patient. upon further quesitoning, patient reported vision was at baseline and that he had required glasses for some time now. visual fields full to confrontation and no deficits detected. patient will require optometry evaluation as an outpatient. # chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: long history of copd, likely poorly controlled due to poor adherence with tiotropium. patient with some wheezing during admission, however with significant tachycardia with albuterol administration. patient started on inhaled ___ defer further managment to primary care physician. # acute renal failure: with initiation of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, serum creatinine incrased from baseline. this was likely exacerbated by patient's poor oral intake during this admission, which was most likely related to his bereavement reaction. # h/o substance abuse: we continued methadone maintenance 135mg daily, confirmed with ___ clinic. patient reported having \"no prescriptions at all\" and required new prescriptions for all of his medications. at time of discharge, however, we encountered difficulty filling prescription for clonazepam as pharmacy records revealed this was prescribed with dr ___ (psychiatry, ___ ) and had been filled on ___. due to the high risk of life threatening withdrawal reaction if this medication is abruptly stopped, we asked mass health to over-ride this and ___ time additional filling of the prescription. patient has long history of substance abuse however and has exhibited strong drug seeking behavior. dr ___ was contacted at above number and alerted about the possibility of prescription abuse; he will follow up with the patient as previously scheduled. defer further managment tt dr ___. # bereavement: psychiatry team consulted due to concerns for grief reaction. we continued outpatient regimen of klonipin, quetiapine, cymbalta. because of ongoing anxiety, quetiapine dose was increased with good results. patient will require outpatient follow up. # social issues: pt is homeless and has difficulty with medical follow up. we arranged for new primary care physician. social services team also consulted, and provided new contact information for housing options as well as transitioning to outpatient social services. # h/o pe: ivc filter in place, s/p lovenox therapy. as above, pe r/o in ed

emboli s/p ivc filter, with long history of substance abuse and non adherence, presenting with hemoptysis, fever and chest pain, found to have multiple pulmonary emboli: #. recurrent pulmonary emboli: although ___ has ivc filter, there is clot under the filter seen on imaging above. given prior history of poor adherence, decision was made not to chronically anticoagulate in past. nevertheless, ___ presented with new, significant thrombotic burden. due to diffuse lower and upper extremity pain, ultrasound of all extremities was obtained to evaluate for further deep vein thrombosis, with only evidcence of thrombosis at left posterior tibial vein. ___ was continued on heparin and remained therapeutic. ___ did not exhibit any signs of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain. we had detailed discussions with ___ about risks of recurrence of hemodynamically significant vte if not anticoagulated. also discussed the importance of close follow up and monitoring if anticoagulated and risk of bleeding if inr is high. he comprehended the information and stated he would be compliant with anticoagulation. given prior history of lack adherence to follow up, hospitalization for severely supra-theraputic levels (16.9), and personality disorder, a multidisciplinary decision was made to attempt to find supervised, structured setting in order assure adherence of plan for anticoagulation. ___ is being continued on lovenox as bridge until coumadin becomes therapeutic, and lovenox should be continued for 2 days while inr therapeutic and then stopped. his inr on day of discharge was 1.9 while on 3 days of 5mg of coumadin. his dose was increased in discharge planning to 6mg daily. reliability of adherence should be re-examined prior to discharging ___ from facility, to decide if coumadin should be continued. this should be done in discussion with the ___ pcp, as well as the setting of is ultimate discharge. . #. hemoptysis: given multiple pulmonary emboli, this most likely represented sub-segmental level emboli causing lung infarction. although ___ has not been observed having any hemoptysis, hematocrit remained stable and no respiratory distress was observed. ___ did not require any blood transfusions during this admission. . #. chest pain: given presentation, ___ was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes. serial ecg's were unchanged from baseline and although sporadic pain persisted, this is likely due to pleuritic irritation secondary to pulmonary emboli. no evidence of ischemia during this admission. #. copd exacerbation: ___ noted to have severe wheezing at admission. his copd is very poorly controlled. ___ was given oral steroids, having completed a taper, and maintained on inhaler regimen per last admission. defer further management to pcp. #. substance abuse: ___ clinic contacted, ___ ___ ___. fax# ___. last dose prior to admission given ___ and confirmed to be 135mg. ___ has been presenting to clinic regularly and has only missed dates when he was been hospitalized. # presyncope: pt may have been had presyncope secondary to poor forward flow with sinus tachycardia while ambulating. no evidence of severe right ventricular dysfunction on on tte. ___ has remained hemodynamically stable. there also was likely a mechanical component as ___ has been previously noted to be unstable on feet & admittedly uncomfortable ambulating at baseline because of pain. ___ will require continued physical therapy and fall precautions. # back pain/leg pain: the ___ complaints of back pain are a chronic issue, constantly reporting ___ pain disproportionate to appearance. he has a documented l1 fracture in ___ with moderate to severe wedging and 40% spinal stenosis. mri of the lumbar spine was done this admission that did not show significant changes since last time. the ___ has as bilateral lower extremity pain likely secondary to stenosis. current regimen does not seem to be fully tx'ing pain

year old man with multiple medical problems (including htn, recurrent vte s/p ivc filter, substance abuse) and frequent hospital admissions, here with several complaints, including persistent cough, burning chest discomfort, \"stinging\" leg pains, and generally feeling unwell. his most recent admission was from ___. at that time, he had chest discomfort and was ruled out for mi. he had acute renal failure, which improved. he also developed a hospital acquired pneumonia. he was initially treated with vanco, cefepime, and flagyl. he was discharged on levofloxacin. after his discharge, sputum culture grew mssa, which was quinolone resistant. it is not clear whether the patient took the prescribed levaquin. . since discharge, the patient has had persistent cough (now for greater than 1 month) which has not improved. cough is productive of yellow sputum, which is brown or blood streaked at times. he reports having fevers as high as 102.5 prior to coming to the hospital this time. . he also complains of a burning chest discomfort which is worst with coughing or with exertion, but which is also present at rest. this is different from the chest discomfort on the last admission, which was throbbing in quality. the current chest discomfort is also reproducible with palpation. . in addition, he complains of leg pain, which is worst with ambulation but also occurs at rest. this is worst in his lower calves, near his ankles. denies leg edema, except sometimes after being on his feet for a more extended time. discomfort is \"stinging\" and is relieved with dilaudid which he has at home. . of note, the patient had been on anticoagulation for h/o recurrent vte. his most recent diagnosis of pe was on ___, during another hospital admission. however, patient was not discharged on anticoagulation after this most recent hospitalizatin because he has a history of non-compliance with all of his medications, has difficulty with follow-up, and there was significant concern about safety since his inr would likely not be monitored appropriately. . in the ed, vs: 100.9, 174/99, 84, 17, 100% on ra. he was given levofloxacin 750mg, albuterol and atrovent nebs, and

recurrent vte, htn, recent admission for chest pain and pneumonia, here with persistent cough, chest discomfort. . # pneumonia: rll pneumonia was diagnosed on last admission, with mssa eventually growing from sputum (after his discharge). pt was discharged on levaquin, but mssa was not quinolone sensitive. pt presented with persistent productive cough, low-grade fever. no hypoxia. he was hemodynamically stable throughout. he received nafcillin initially to treat mssa pneumonia. when the patient remained afebrile and otherwise stable, he was switched to po cefpodoxime, with continued improvement. repeat sputum culture grew only oral flora. blood cultures were not finalized at the time of discharge, but had no growth to date. of note, the patient had a small amount of hemoptysis, similar to that noted on prior admissions. sputum afb smear neg x2 last admission. in addition to mssa pna, pt had recent pe, so several potential explanations for hemoptysis. the patient was discharged with po cefpodoxime to complete a 7 day course. . # chest discomfort: no documented history of cad. atypical burning chest discomfort, somewhat different from last admission. pt has had many admissions for chest discomfort. pneumonia could be causing some chest discomfort, particularly from musculoskeletal strain with coughing. pain is reproducible with palpation, most suggestive of costochondritis vs. muscle strain from coughing. once the creatinine normalized, nsaids were given to treat musculoskeletal pain/costochondritis. as gi etiology was also possible, pt was started on ppi. patient ruled out for mi, and was monitored on telemetry without significant events. low dose aspirin was resumed (pt had been on this previously, and it appears to have been stopped when other anticoagulation was on-board, which is not the case now). in terms of other cardiac regimen, no bb due to substance abuse hx, no ace due to past arf with this (per prior records). . # acute renal failure: cr 1.4 on admission, improved to 1.2 (baseline) with gentle hydration. likely related to infection, dehydration, suspect pre-renal arf. . # anemia: longstanding microcytic anemia. hct slightly below baseline on admission. pt was guaiac neg in ed, and hct remained stable. iron studies most consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. . #. recurrent pulmonary emboli: s/p ivc filter. no longer on anticoagulation due to very poor compliance and followup (safety concerns - see records from last admission). pt was not hypoxic or tachycardic during this admission. anticoagulation was not restarted. . # hypertension: history of malignant htn with poor medication compliance. continued home regimen of clonidine patch. (regimen was simplified to this single agent during last hospitalization). bp was reasonably well-controlled on this regimen. . # diastolic, chronic congestive heart failure: well-compensated, with no evidence of acute exacerbation. low-dose aspirin was resumed as above. patient is not on ace or diuretics as an outpatient. . # psychiatry: continued klonopin and cymbalta. . # polysubstance abuse: on methadone maintenance program. continued outpatient methadone dose of 135mg daily. letter to methadone program documenting last inpatient dose was given to patient on discharge. . #. copd: no evidence of acute exacerbation at this time. continued home regimen of inhalers with nebs as needed. . # leg pain: chronic issue, as it is mentioned in multiple prior records. there was a documented l1

micu. . 2. substance abuse. patient has long history of drug abuse. during his stay, he was often noted to be hording pills. he would not swallow the pills that were administered and he would hide pills in his underwear. when he returned to the micu on ___, it was suspected that had horded pills and then taken a supply of these medications all at once resulting in minimal responsiveness and hypotension. . 3. cellulitis. patient noted to have a left lower extremity cellulitis at the site of an iv. he was treated with one week of vancomycin and unasyn. his antibiotic course was completed while he was inpatient. . 4. hypertension. patient reported to have history of hypertension and reports significant concern about his blood pressure being elevated. however, blood pressure fluctuations are likely related to drug abuse and withdrawal in addition to baseline essential hypertension. during hospital stay, his antihypertesnives were uptitrated. on ___, patient was found to be hypotensive to ___ systolic and unresponsive likely secondary to up-titration of antihypertensives plus suspected hording of oxycodone/klonopin/methadone. the micu team felt that his hypertension should not be aggressively managed given his history of poor compliance as and outpatient and fluctuations of bp due to drug abuse. patient seemed to be at greater risk for episodes of hypotension than the consequences of chronic hypertension. . 5. hypotensive episode/unresponsiveness. patient transferred to the micu on ___ after a code was called. he did not receive cpr because he was found to have a pulse and sbp in ___. he was suspected to have taken a stash of narcotics and benzos. he became arousable at the mention of narcan. in the micu, he was evaluated for pe with echo which did not show right heart strain. he cannot get a cta due to renal failure and v/q scan is likely to be difficult to interpret in setting of prior multiple pes. he was started on empiric anticoagulation with lovenox with the knowledge that he would not continue on anticoagulation as an outpatient due to history of poor compliance. bp and mental status improved overnight and he was trasnfered out of the unit on ___. . . history of recurrent pe. patient has had recurrent pes. he has an ivc filter. he has not been anticoaulated due to poor compliance. there was breif concern for a recurrent pe when

polysubstance abuse who presented to the ed with chest and abdominal pain and was found to have an anterior stemi. he is now status post bms to the mid-lad. post cardiac catheterization he presented to the ccu with acute onset pulmonary edema and respiratory failure and was intubated on assist control ventilation. he was diuresed with iv lasix initially and he was successfully extubated without complications on hospital day 2. post-extubation, there were no further respiratory issues and lasix was eventually discontinued. serial cxrs showed resolution of the pulmonary edema and the patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently >97% on room air. as the patient was being screened for possible placement in a rehabilitation facility or a shelter it was decided to check his ppd. ppd testing done with a negative ppd confirmed on ___. coronary artery disease: in terms of ___ coronary artery disease, he underwent catheterization at admission with bms placed to lad. his ck peaked at 76 and his tropt peaked at 0.66. he was continued on plavix 75mg po daily, 325mg daily aspirin and started on high dose 80mg of atorvastatin daily. he was kept on integrillin drip for 18 hours. after the catheterization, there were no further episodes of chest pain with the exception of some mild ___ intermittent chest pain on ___ which was reproducible on exam and felt to be musculoskeletal in origin at the left sterno-costal junction. ekg showed t-wave inversions in v2-v5 which had been present in multiple prior ekgs, otherwise nsr, rate mid-70s and oxygen saturation 98% ra. warm compresses helped to alleviate this costo-sternal discomfort. mr. ___ was advised that he would need to continue clopidogrel for at least one month and aspirin for life. he is aware of the risks of repeat cardiac events and/or stroke if he fails to adhere to this regimen and he was advised to be compliant with his medications after discharge. pump function:regarding pump function, the patient presented to the ccu with acute pulmonary edema on imaging in the setting of a recent mi. he was intubated in the cardiac cath lab. recent ttes had shown no baseline systolic heart failure, although likely there was a component of diastolic dysfunction in the setting of severe htn. a tte after the cath showed lvef of 30% and apical hypokinesis with lv mural thrombus. thus, he likely developed this systolic heart failure after suffering his recent mi. he was started on acei and bb to limit further remodeling and control his hr. to manage his mural thrombus, he was started on a heparin drip and then bridged to coumadin 2.5 mg qhs and his inr was 2.7 on ___. he has failed anticoagulation in the past due to medication non-compliance. mr. ___ has a history of pulmonary embolisms and dvts per records and he had an ivc filter placed in ___. the patient was warned of the increased risk of embolic stroke and blood clots in the acute setting of apical thrombus and hypokinesis as well as large dvts. he was initially started on heparin drip and later bridged to warfarin 2.5mg qhs which he continued for the rest of his hospitalization. he had his daily ___ checked. . rhythm: the patient had occasional sinus tachycardia bouts with exertion but he was in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry for the majority of his hospital stay. .. respiratory failure: as above, he presented to the ccu intubated presumably due to acute pulmonary edema in the setting of poor cardiac output and recent acs/ stemi. he was extubated without complications and was gradually weaned back to room air and had oxygen saturations of 97-99% on room air at time of discharge. abdominal pain / constipation: mr. ___ had some mild lower quadrant abdominal distention and pain with deep palpation. he had severe constipation which was probably exacerbated by his methadone regimen and multiple psychiatric medications. he was started on a bowel regimen with dulcolax, senna, colace and then lactulose was added and patient began to have regular daily bowel movements and his mild abdominal distension and nausea improved thereafter for the remainder of his hospital stay. coffee-ground emesis: at time of presentation, it appeared he was having abdominal discomfort because he grimaced on deep palpation of his abdomen. pancreatic and liver enzymes were sent and all returned normal. the abdominal pain later resolved post-extubation with the exception of some mild lower quadrant distension and tenderness in the setting of severe constipation. ct ___ was negative for pulmonary or intra-aortic process. abdominal imaging was unremarkable. he was also noted to have coffee ground aspirate from his og tube, which cleared after gastric lavage. however, on hospital day 1 his hematocrit dropped rather precipitously from 29 to 24. a central line was placed and 2u prbcs transfused to which he responded appropriately with a hematocrit bump to 30. gi was consulted and did not believe there was any urgent indication for scope, as his bleeding had resolved. . he was started on bid ppi and tapered to daily 40mg po dose. his hematocrit increased to baseline mid ___ and remained stable for the rest of the hospitalization. gi service would like to perform upper endoscopy, but as he is no longer actively bleeding there is no indication for an urgent inpatient procedure and gi felt that patient could follow up at a later date as an outpatient for an elective egd. # hypertension: he has a history of malignant hypertension managed with clonidine, amlodipine, and unclear whether he takes hctz as his discharge summaries reflect different regimens. we attempted to work with an acei and bb given comorbidity of cad keeping in mind that he has very difficult to control htn at baseline and may require additional medications. ultimately, blood pressure was well controlled with a triple regimen of 5mg daily lisinopril, clonidine patch and 25mg po bid metoprolol. .. # copd: we continued the patient' home ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed while he was hospitalized. .. # right ___ dvt: identified on ___ after patient complained of right groin pain and right leg became swollen. vascular surgery consult done and thrombectomy or other procedure was deemed not needed as circulation appears intact, there is no evidence for compartment syndrome and swelling is slowly resolved. pt has an ivc filter that was placed after an episode of pe in the past. coumadin has been continued and pt will need to continue this indefinitely. pt will also need a hematology consult in the future to assess for clotting derangements once dvt is resolved. pt will need a repeat ___ ultrasound in ___ months to assess for interval change. the patient's compliance with his inr checks at ___ and the importance of taking his daily warfarin to prevent strokes and additional clots or complications was stressed and reinforced on multiple occasions. # methadone maintenance: we continued his home methadone dose of 135 mg daily. .. # depression / anxiety: stable; we continued his home duloxetine, clonazepam, and quetiapine initially and psychiatry was consulted for additional input during the ___ hospital stay and the patient's seroquel was increased to 200mg qhs dosing alongside 50mg bid prn seroquel regimen as well. the patient continued to have some hypotension and seroquel was discontinued. he had his duloxetine gradually uptitrated and his symptoms were well controlled at time of discharge. # social : social work consult was arranged to explore the best approach for the patient to be able to more easily afford his medications. a search was initiated to help place mr. ___ in a short term housing/rehabilitation/partial shelter setting given his multiple medical comorbidities and his social situation which is complicated by his polysubstance abuse history and intermittent homelessness. physical therapy also evaluated mr. ___ and ___ that he was stable for discharge and felt he was physically capable to resume his pre-hospitalization activity. #prophylaxis: dvt prophylaxis was with heparin sq, then switched to heparin drip after the finding of apical thrombus on tte and patient ultimately bridged to coumadin. gi prophylaxis with ppi bid initially given concern over potential gi bleed. ppi later switched to 40mg daily protonix. he was kept on a

2d or color doppler. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (lvef= 35-40 %) with global hypokinesis and akineis aof the distal lv/apex. basal segments move best. there is no ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal free wall function. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. trace aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, an apical thrombus is no longer seen and the lv systolic function is slightly better. cardiac perfusion persantine ___: impression: 1. moderate fixed apical defect and moderate fixed distal anterior and distal inferior wall defects which are likely secondary to the reported mi. 2. increase in the left ventricular size and decrease in lvef. cta chest w/ and w/o contrast ___: impression: 1. negative examination for pulmonary embolism. 2. mediastinal and axillary enlarged lymph nodes with splenomegaly. 3. improvement of previously described hazy infiltration in the right middle lobe. brief hospital course: this is a homeless ___ year old male with a past medical history of of recent stemi s/p bms to lad, hypertension, post-tramatic stress disorder, and depression who presents with hypotension and chest pain. 1) hypotension: hypotension is likely secondary to patient's recent myocardial infarction. patient was ruled out for possibility of a new myocardial infarction by three negative sets of cardiac enzymes, no st-t wave changes on ecg. he also underwent a nuclear perfusion stress test that did not show any new defects. an echocardiogram actually showed improved lv systolic function compared to ___. patient also had a cta that did not indicate new pulmonary embolism. adrenal insufficiency was considered though a cosyntropin stimulation test ruled this out. patient does have an elevated tsh of 4.4, though this is difficult to interpret in the setting of recent hospitalization. patient's blood pressure medications were held for the first few hospital days and blood pressure remained stable, with systolics slowly increasing to the 110's-120's. lisinopril was restarted and has been titrated up to 5 mg daily. patient was also restarted on metoprolol 25 mg daily. 2) chest pain: as noted above, patient was ruled out for mi by cardiac enzymes and an nuclear perfusion test that did not show any new defects. patient continues to describe brief intermittent left sided chest pressure. the etiology of this pain is very unclear. there was no evidence on ecg or echocardiogram of pericardial effusion. pain is not reproducible with palpation making a musculoskeletal or costochondritis etiology less likely. patient is to continue taking daily lisinopril, metoprolol and aspirin for cardioprotecion. 3) pancytopenia: patient noted to have pancytopenia on admission. wbc ct and platelets did return to normal range over course of hospitalization. patient does remain anemic. iron studies indicated anemia of chronic disease. patient's reticulocyte count is 1.4, which is the low end of normal. notably, patient was found to have enlarged spleen on chest ct. patient has an appointment to follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient to further work-up possible causes of decreased bone marrow activity and splenomegaly. 4)recurrent pulmonary emboli, s/p ivc: as noted above, new pulmonary embolus was considered as possible cause of both hypotension and chest pain. pt had cta that did not indicate evidence of new pe. patient was maintained on warfarin for anticoagulation. we did not discharge the patient with a prescription for coumadin because neither the ___ clinic here at ___ nor the patient's primary care provider at ___ ___ associates are able to prescribe coumadin or monitor inr for someone who is homeless given the technical difficulties of communicating results and dose adjustments. the only option for homeless patients on coumadin is to be followed at the ___ ___ anticoagulation clinic, which requires that patients have a pcp at ___. for the reason, the patient agreed to have us connect him with a new primary care provider at ___ so that he can utilize the ___ clinic services there. patient was also given the option of being placed in a nursing home so as to have an environment where his medical needs could be more closely attended to, however, the patient declined this option. 5) chronic obstructive airway disease: patient was continued on his nebulizer and inhaler treatments. 6) somnolence: at time of admission patient seemed rather somnolent and there was concern that his clonazepam, seroquel cymbalta or methadone may have been contributing factors. patient's clonazepam dose was reduced to 1 mg tid. nursing staff was also instructed to make sure that the patient swallowed all medications, given his history of hoarding medications. he was seen by psychiatry who felt that clonazepam could slowly be increased back to 2 mg tid if patient did not continue to demonstrate somnolence. we were able to titrate dose back up to 2 mg tid and patient did not demonstrate further evidence of daytime somnolence. 7) depression: at beginning of hospital stay patient reported that he felt extremely depressed. as noted above, patient was seen by

saturation near 80% and blood pressure to 82/palpable. abg showed 7.33/59/50. patient was placed on nrb with subsequent abg 7.33/56/76, lactate 0.7. patient was started on heparin gtt given concern for pulmonary embolism. he was guiac negative with no hidden medications found (history of hiding medications). patient was transfered to the icu for hypotension and hypoxia. micu course: patient has a history of hypoxia and hypotension secondary to stacking his clonidine, clonazepam and methadone medications. he had an acute episode of hypoxia to high ___ and hypotension and was transferred to the micu. his blood pressure stabilized with sbp in 110's and his spo2 rose to mid ___ on nc shortly after arrival in the icu. likely that his hypoxia/hypotension were related to his medications. he was ruled out for mi w/ serial enzymes and repeated ecgs and transferred back to the floor. levofloxacin was also started given concern for pneumonia. pe was very low on differential as he did not have any chest pain or tachycardia. lenis were negative and his hypoxia/hypotension resolved quickly after arrival in the unit. medicine course: on return to medicine floor, patient reported persistent lower extremity swelling. he was found to have clots in left ventricle and distal to ivc filter, extending into both lower extremities. remainder of hospital course was as follows. 1. ivc,

previously scheduled to see hematology as an outpatient for further work-up of suspected thrombophilia but failed to follow-up. should continue on coumadin as outpatient with close follow-up for inr checks. 2. evaluation for competency: sparked by frequent admissions thought to be secondary to medication noncompliance. patient has many serious medical problems but most pressing issue during this hospital course was evaluation of patient's understanding of his medical situation and the necessary measures to care for himself. per report, patient is frequent inpatient and is chronically noncompliant with many medical treatments - e.g. coumadin for hypercoaguability. several parties, including primary ___ medical team, primary care provider, psychiatry, social work, and case management worked together and with patient to optimize care at this hospitalization and potential hospitalizations in the future. through such meetings we found that the patient appears to understand his illness, is not connected with ___, and follows up regularly with his ___ clinic. social work identified ___, a shelter in ___ which distributes medications to residents and has a nurse on site that can check inr, as a good destination for discharge. patient agreed with this plan. patient to also continue visits in hca with dr. ___. 3. hemoptysis: patient reported 6 months of hemoptysis. reported recent ppd was negative. ppd was placed ___ was negative. cta was concerning for parenchymal process in the lungs. ct sinus was negative for sinusitis. per pulmonary consult team, etiology likely related to airway inflammation. sputum cultures were attempted several times but always found to be contaminated specimens. afb negative by sputum acid fast smear. 4. acute on chronic systolic heart failure: lvef has varied between ___ over last few months as patient recovered from stemi (2 months prior to admission). bnp elevated on admission from baseline. on admission, physical exam and cxr suggested fluid overload. improved with diuresis. continued aspirin 325 mg po daily and placed on low-salt, heart healthy diet. ace-inhibitor was held given hypotension prior to micu stay and systolic blood pressure consistently between 90 and 110 thereafter. 5. liver disease: patient with history of hbv and hcv. asterixis on admission which resolved with lactulose. no ascites was seen on

old male with coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, history of pulmonary embolus status post inferior vena cava filter not on coumadin due to med non-compliance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and history of drug abuse, admitted with dyspnea and altered mental status. 1. altered mental status: the patient presented with altered mental status upon admission to the floor from the emergency department. he was then immediately transferred to the icu for further care, as there was concern for an atenolol overdose, with a heart rate in the ___. he has a history of overdosing on medications while hospitalized. narcan was given with good response, suggestive of a narcotic overdose. the patient then had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which was managed well with lasix iv. urine tox screen was positive for methadone and benzodiazepines. the patient's altered mental status improved on ___, and the patient became alert and oriented x 3. ciwa scale was started after transfer from the icu to the floor, and was discontinued the next day after patient did not score. initially, psychotropic meds were held. as mental status improved, methadone and benzodiazepine therapy were restarted with recommendations from the psyciatry consult service. the patient tolerated this well, and seroquel and duloxetine were also restarted. it was thought that the patient's diminished mental status upon presentation was secondary to mild renal insufficiency in the setting of methadone and benzodiazapine therapy. the patient was evaluated by psychiatry, given his history of anti-social personality disorder, depression/anxiety, and polysubstance abuse in remission. psychiatric evaluation revealed a patient who was not psychotic, and did not have any active, acute psychiatric issues, and was deemed to have capacity. there were no further mental status changes during the remainder of his hospitalization. 2. pulmonary edema: the patient developed acute shortness of breath, tachypnea, and wheezing upon arrival to the icu. plain chest film at this time showed evidence of pulmonary edema and fluid overload. it was likely that the patient developed pulmonary edema, possibly in the setting of hypertension following narcan administration. the patient responded well to lasix iv. patient also experienced brief increased oxygen requirement on the floor, which again improved with lasix and bronchodilator/anti-cholinergic therapy. the patient was discharged on room air with clear lung sounds and no subjective shortness of breath. 3. history of pulmonary embolus status post inferior vena cava filter. he was initially placed on heparin gtt in the icu; however, after a conversation with the patient's pcp, the heparin gtt was stopped and the patient's anticoagulation was held. the patient is a poor candidate for coumadin, given his persistent noncompliance. anti-coagulation was held during his hospitalization secondary to medical non-compliance, and the patient was discharged without anti-coagulation. 4. polysubstance abuse in remission. patient has history of substance abuse. he is on methadone maintance at baseline. the ___ clinic was called today, and the patient's current dose is 125 mg daily. he was thus restarted on his methadone after his mental status improved, and was continued on this dose for the duration of his hospital course. 5. uti - the patient began complaining of dysuria and found to have a urine culture postive for pansensitive e. coli. he was started on ciprofloxacin and told to complete a ___. cad - he had been discharged previously on metoprolol, but this was not restarted while in the hospital secondary to systolics in the 100s. he is scheduled for follow up and should restart his metoprolol at that time. he was continued on his outpatient dose of aspirin, simvastatin and lisinopril. 7. copd - he was maintained on his nebulizers (albuterol, atrovent). 8. gerd - stable. continuted

to assess for an intracardiac shunt due to suboptimal image quality. left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. there is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/aneurysm of he apex and mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (lvef = 50 %). the right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. the aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. there is no aortic valve stenosis. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. the pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. there is no pericardial effusion. impression: suboptimal image quality. normal left ventricular cavity size with apical aneurysm/akinesis. no definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. ___ cta chest: 1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 2. consolidations in the lungs bilaterally, are likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia, with reactive lymphadenopathy. 3. extensive abdominal wall varices, gynecomastia, and splenomegaly, suggestive of chronic liver disease. cirrhosis can't be excluded. 4. new 3 mm nodule within the left upper lobe. if the patient is at high risk for malignancy, or has a history of smoking, a 12 month followup with chest ct is recommended for further evaluation. ___ cxr: comparison to ___. no relevant change. bilateral areas of atelectasis. low lung volumes. mild cardiomegaly. no pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. no pleural effusion. ___ arterial flows: on the right side, triphasic doppler waveforms are seen in the right femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. the right abi was 1.29. on the left side, triphasic doppler waveforms are seen at the left femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. the left abi was 1.28. pulse volume recordings showed

demonstrated in the posterior tibial veins of the upper calf bilaterally. the peroneal veins were not visualized. asymmetry of waveforms in the right and left common femoral veins likely reflect collateral pathways in the setting of chronic ivc thrombus. tortuous collaterals are seen superior to the left common femoral vein. no evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. impression: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the imaged right or left lower extremity veins. nonvisualization of the peroneal veins of the bilateral upper calf. ___ cxr: battery pack overlies the left mid chest. mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears slightly worse compared to the prior study. no focal consolidation is seen. there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. the cardiac and mediastinal

htn, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder p/w unclear duration of increasing ___ edema, inability to ambulate and worsening dyspnea. #dyspnea: patient reported worsening shortness of breath during hospital stay, initially presumed from volume overload as below and diuresed with iv lasix. patient had reported increasing sputum production with wheezes on exam thus he was treated for copd exacerbation, given levofloxacin and prednisone (40 mg) and completed a 5 day course. he had some symptomatic improvement however continued to have intermittent oxygen use, per him he uses ___ l o2 at night. he underwent a cta on ___ without e/o pe, but revealed bilateral consolidations c/f multifocal pneumonia, with reactive lymphadenopathy, however he was afebrile without any leukocytosis. he underwent a tte, which showed mild left ventricular hypokinesis, no significant valvular pathology, no clear shunting. inpatient pulmonary was consulted who found no evidence of desaturations. while his venous collaterals could lead to pooling in the lower extremities with resultant reduction in venous return to the heart and hypoxemia, this was not demonstrated on walking with mr. ___. his wheezing seemed more related to secretions than copd. he endorsed aspiration symptoms and has risk factor with his poor dentition. patient's orthostatic vital signs were stable, and was discharged with no additional oxygen requirement. speech and swallow evaluated him and this showed that the patient had mild oropharyngeal dysphagia marked by impulsivity in acceptance, reduced mastication, edentulous status, and one episode of wet vocal quality with a very large bolus of thin liquids. their recommendations included pureed to ground solids (per pt's baseline preference) with thin liquids. he was instructed to sit upright for all po intake, take single sips, and continue with food preparation consistent with his edentulous status. medications should be whole in applesauce to avoid consecutive sips of thin liquids. #acute decompensation of diastolic heart failure: no clear history c/w acute chf exacerbation. reports medication compliance. last ef in ___ noted to be 50% and last discharge weight was 103kg on ___. bilateral lower extremity edema, pulmonary vascular congestion, weight gain and admitted medication non-compliance prompt concern for acute chf exacerbation. beyond medication and diet non-compliance, could also be substance use. ischemia less likely given stable ecg and normal troponins. notably, patient admitted in ___ of this year with similar complaints; at that time he had mild congestion on cxr and bnp of 1711 (lower than today's). after diuresis, his leg edema did not resolve. patient was continued on home po lasix and was net negative on urine output. #chronic venous stasis: this was likely related to lymphedema from recurrent dvt with minor component from ___. there was no evidence of overlying cellulitis. in the past, his leg pain has limited his mobility significantly. he was last discharged to ___ for continued physical therapy. his chronic findings are also likely from thrombosed ivc filter. he has primarily been managed as an outpatient by diuresis with lasix and pain medications. he was assessed by vascular surgery who felt that he has bilateral strongly palpable pulses which suggests good perfusion to the leg and foot. his right lower extremity ulcer is likely ___ chronic venous stasis changes as he has severe stasis skin changes. they recommended no further surgical intervention. he was asked to elevate his legs as much as possible, and have ace wraps over legs. imaging showed no further dvt in lower legs and no arterial flow issues. #chest pain: known h/o cad s/p stemi w/ bms to lad. troponins negative x2 in ed today. ekg without ischemic changes. patient had intermittent chest pains during his hospital course, associated with days he was given iv diuretics. this corresponded to runs of nsvt on telemetry monitoring. his electrolytes were stable with no derangements and ekg was unchanged. given no documented history of varices, his nadolol was switched to metoprolol low dose for nsvt. aspirin 81 was added for secondary prevention. he was continued on home atorvastatin 40 mg po qpm. #cad s/p stemi with bms to lad: continued aspirin and atorvastatin as above. #hcv cirrhosis: complicated by hepatic encephalopathy in the past; has no known history of esophageal varices. no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy at this time. some ruq tenderness. lfts were normal. patient's abdominal imaging showed evidence of splenomegaly, abdominal wall varices, and cirrhosis cannot be excluded. given hepatitis c history, patient should get further liver evaluation for workup. #anemia, chronic: ___ be related to cirrhosis. he may need further eval as an outpatient. # polysubstance abuse: patient has long history of chronic narcotics use and heroin abuse. given intermittent chest pain, assessed utox/stox for substances which were negative. requested oxycontin immediately on arrival; patient appeared somnolent however, so this was withheld and only provided intermittently when patient was awake/alert. continued methadone 65mg qd which was verified with his ___. # copd: at home, patient is on ___ nc. most recent copd exacerbation in ___ for which he was given a prednisone burst and 5 day course of augmentin. his lung exam revealed wheezes with preserved o2 sats, good movement of air. he was given a 5 day course of prednisone 40 and levofloxacin for copd exacerbation. # chronic hx pe/dvt: inr was therapeutic, making recurrent dvt unlikely, with no evidence of new clots on lower extremity ultrasound. he was continued on warfarin. # chronic pain: long-acting oxycontin increased to 40mg tid by pcp ___ ___. some somnolence on exam today likely due to co-administration of oxycodone and methadone. continued gabapentin 800mg tid as well. continue

mild splenomegaly. 3. normal biliary tree. abdominal xray (___): nonspecific bowel gas pattern. cxr (___): pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, but there is now mild interstitial edema. mild cardiac enlargement is stable. there is no pleural effusion. there are no focal pulmonary abnormalities to suggest pneumonia and no appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. ekg (___): sinus bradycardia, old anteroseptal infarct, and no ste/std/twi suggestive of ischemia. ekg (___): nsr, qtc 408 brief hospital course: mr. ___ is a medically complex ___ m h/o cad, chf, dvt on couamdin, multiple recent admissions for dyspnea, difficulty ambulating, who presented again with altered mental status, dyspnea, diffuse abdominal pain, and difficulty ambulating, in the setting of mild decompensated heart failure. acute medical problems: ======================= #acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: on admission, based on b/l pitting edema, worsening dyspnea, and pulmonary edema on cxr, concern for mild decompensated heart failure. ischemic heart disease less likely in setting of negative troponin x1. pt takes meds at home and reports med compliance, but concern for overall poor social situation suggest that med or diet noncompliance are possible. weight on last hospital discharge was 108.9 kg. weight on admission was 111 kg and he was given lasix iv until he reached his baseline weight, when he was restarted on his home lasix 40 mg po. he was net negative on this and he described an episode when he fell (see below), so lasix was held the following 3 days. he was sent home on 20 mg lasix po ___ of his home dose). #copd exacerbation: on admission, patient's lung exam is diffusely wheezy, suggesting mild copd exacerbation as well. patient is satting well on home 2l o2 and does not report any new cough or sputum production. it is possible that in the setting of altered mental status, failure to thrive, he has not been using his inhalers as prescribed. he was given prednisone 40 mg qd for 5 days, standing duonebs, and home tiotropium. initially, antibiotics were held to avoid qtc prolongation. however, since is still complained of sputum production, he was started on levofloxacin on ___ and his qtc was 408 on ___. he completed this course on ___ (6 days). #uri: throughout his admission, he has been complaining of increased mucus production, weakness, sore throat, and headache. this was thought to be due to a common cold that could exacerbate his underlying reactive airway. he was started on fluticasone 2 puff bid and cepacol lozenges. he will go home with fluticasone, nasal spray, and cepacol lozenges. #subacute abdominal pain: the patient has provided a very unclear history about his abdominal pain, but he reports that his abdomen has been distended and tender for one week, and he reports that he has not been eating for one week as well. all initial lft's, lipase, cbc wnl, and his exam is only moderately tender to palpation. his abdominal swelling is likely due to mild chf exacerbation causing abdominal swelling since he had no ascites on ed us. he has caput medusa on exam and a history of ivc filter thrombosis in the past. unclear if this can contribute to pain. ruq us on ___ showed no focal lesions and normal biliary tree and kub showed no obstruction. he is no longer complaining of abdominal pain. #altered mental status: was somnolent on admission, but became alert by the morning. apparently due to psychiatric history he has waxing/waning sensorium and has presented similarly to this prior. unclear the cause but so far metabolic workup negative, infectious workup so far negative, no leukocytosis, no h/o liver disease to suggest he. he is on many sedating medications which are likely to contribute. initially held gabapentin, but was restarted after two days due to complaints of leg pain. he was continued on his pain regimen as stated below. #fall: on ___, had a fall while going to the bathroom. he does not know what time this occurred, but denies loc or hitting his head. denied palpitations or any neurologic deficits. he felt graying out and then landed on his knees. he used the sink to help himself up. he did not notify any nursing staff at this time. no concern for neurological or cardiac abnormalities, but given his diuresis (below his baseline weight by ___ kg) and borderline low bp, hypovolemia is a possibility. orthostatic vs were normal. we held his lasix 2 days after. ___ saw him and recommended home with ___, but he has refused ___ in the past. #chest pain: he had chest pain in the ed with negative troponin and an ekg not concerning for active ischemia. on ___, he also complained of ___ sharp, nonpleuritic, left sternal chest pain that was slightly tender to palpation. cxr showed improved pulmonary vascular congestion, but interstitial edema and no evidence to suggest pna. ekg showed no evidence of active ischemia. low concern for pe (no increased oxygen requirement or pleuritis), acs (ekg at baseline without signs of active ischemia), or intrapulmonary process (no evidence of pna). thus, it is likely musculoskeletal pain or radiation from his abdominal discomfort. this resolved on its own. chronic medical issues: ======================= #frequent hospitalizations and noncompliance: this patient has had multiple recent admissions. while he says he takes his medications, he has multiple complex medical issues and it does not seem like he can ___ for himself adequately. he claims he does not have a ___, but past documentation has suggested that he did, but he refuses working with them when they visit. he also refuses to work with ___ and he has stated that he refuses to see anyone in clinic other than dr. ___ on ___. an appointment was made for him at ___ on ___, but it questionable if he will show up. #anemia: patient has a history of anemia with baseline hemoglobin in mid 7 to 8 range. unclear reason for this in the past. iron studies suggest iron deficiency anemia (low ferritin, high/normal tibc). no evidence of bleeding and guaiac negative stool #chronic venous stasis: likely related to lymphedema from recurrent dvt with minor component from ___. there were no signs of acute infection. he denied any improvement in his leg pain while hospitalized, but his baseline is difficult to assess given his vague descriptions. he continued on his home gabapentin and was given lasix throughout his hospital stay with significant improvement of his lower extremity edema. he never had signs of bleeding or infection of his ulcers. #cad s/p stemi with bms to lad: he was continue on his home aspirin and atorvastatin. #chronic hx pe/dvt: he was continued on his home warfarin and did not require much adjustment throughout his hospital stay. #chronic pain: he was continued on his home methadone 65 mg and 10 mg qd as well as his home oxycodone sr 40 mg q8h. there were several episodes when he accused nursing staff of not giving him his medication, so two nurses had to give it and watch him take it. for constipation, he was continued on his home bowel regimen. #htn: he had borderline blood pressures during his hospital stay, so his home metoprolol was held. #hld: he was continued on his home atorvastatin #depression/ptsd: he was continued on his home clonazepam 2 mg po tid and duloxetine #bph: he was continue on his home tamsulosin 0.4 mg po qhs #gerd and history of gi bleeding: he was continued on his home omeprazole 20 mg po daily #nutritional supplementation: he was continued on his home folate and multivitamin transitional issues: ==================== -his home metoprolol tartrate 12.5 bid was held in the setting of low bp. consider restarting it if his bp starts to rise. -his home lasix 40 mg was cut to 20 mg in the setting of borderline low bp. -compliance on his medications needs to be addressed, especially with his lasix. -he may become a danger to himself due to noncompliance and refusal of services. -he conveyed some abuse-type behavior with his methadone while in the hospital. consider weaning as an outpatient. -his weight on discharge was 106.8 kg (235.45 lb) -he will

pain, who was found to fluid overload (up 30 pounds from his dry weight) suggestive of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. he was aggressively diuresed with 120mg iv lasix until he was at his dry weight, but his shortness of breath was still not at baseline. his exam then was significant for diffuse wheezing. he was treated with prednisone and doxycycline for 5 day course for a copd exacerbation, and his wheezing and shortness of breath further improved. he became hyponatremic in the setting of aggressive diuresis. nephrology and cardiology were consulted. diuretics were held for over a week, but he continued to auto-diurese and his sodium continued to drop, but eventually trended upwards. there was concern that his chronically occluded ivc filter was depleting his intravascular volume and perfusion, and vascular surgery was consulted, but recommended no intervention at this time. his new maintenance diuretic regimen was difficult to determine due to auto-diuresis contributing to his hyponatremia. he was discharged on torsemide 20mg. discharge dry weight: 106.1kg # abdominal pain # acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (hfpef): abdominal pain likely secondary to chf exacerbation as he has presented multiple times with similar complaints and seems to improve with diuresis. ct a/p unremarkable. he similarly improved with diuresis. patient presented with weight of 114kg, his weight upon last discharge was 99.1 kg (standing). exacerbation likely secondary to medication non-compliance. he was diuresed aggressively with 120mg iv lasix until he appeared euvolemic. his shortness of breath improved, and he was satting in high 90's on room air. his diuresis was complicated by hyponatremia, in which diuresis was held from ___, but patient continued to auto-diuresis. cardiology and nephrology was consulted. suspected that his previous dose of 80mg torsemide daily resulted in excessive diuresis, and that patient was overloaded secondary to noncompliance, not failure of medical management. his new maintenance dose was difficult ot determine, but after many adjustments, he was stable on torsemide 20mg. he was discharged at a weight of 106.1kg. patient also received a tte, which revealed evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and lvef of 45%. #hyponatremia hyponatremia likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of aggressive diuresis. urine electrolytes consistent with this etiology as well. his diuretics will held as above, but his na continue to fluctuate due to auto-diuresis of unclear etiology. nephrology was consulted to assist with volume status. vascular surgery was also consulted due to concern that patient's chronically occluded ivc filter was contributing to poor intravascular volume and perfusion. however, vascular surgery reported that no surgical intervention was indicated, and that the procedure would be very high risk. patient's hyponatremia improved after holding diuresis and determining an appropriate diuretic regimen as above. # chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: his home medications were continued, he stated that he does not take several of his inhalers at home. his shortness of breath improved with diuresis, however, he still had very significant wheezing concerning for concomitant copd exacerbation. he was treated with 5 days of prednisone and doxycycline (due to prolonged qtc) with improvement of his respiratory status and wheezing. # history of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis on warfarin: home warfarin was continued and adjusted as needed throughout this admission. # pancytopenia: differential diagnosis includes marrow suppression versus mds. ___ monitored throughout admission and appeared chronic and stable. # epidermal inclusion cyst: was likely inflamed versus infected on admission, ruptured spontaneously with no systemic signs of infection. acute care surgery was consulted, did not have any further recommendations. chronic issues: =============== # depression/post-traumatic stress disorder: continued home clonazepam, duloxetine. # coronary artery disease s/p st-elevation myocardial infarction: continued home metoprolol, atorvastatin. # elephantiasis nostras verrucosa / chronic venous stasis: continued wound care and compression as tolerated, wound care consult ordered. vascular surgery was consulted as above, recommending no urgent intervention. # chronic pain: continued home methadone, oxycodone, gabapentin. # benign prostatic hyperplasia: continued home tamsulosin. ***transitional issues*** - repeat basic metabolic panel and evaluate for hyponatremia within one week after discharge. - patient will likely need titration of his diuretics based on his volume status (discharge dry weight: 106.1kg). - continue to monitor inr, adjust warfarin as indicated. - consider outpatient pfts, adding inhaled glucocorticoid for copd. - patient was found to have evidence of pulmonary hypertension on tte;

feelings of chills, and wheezing on exam suggestive of copd exacerbation. chf exacerbation was also considered as a possible cause of his dyspnea. bnp was elevated at 1153, although it has been as high as 2,900 on prior admissions. additionally, patient's dyspnea did not improve with 40mg iv lasix in ed(although this dose is comparable to his home 20 mg torsemide)and cxr showed only mild pulmonary vascular congestion. the possibility of acute pe was also considered as a possible cause of his dyspnea. the patient has a previous history of pe, but cta did not demonstrate acute pe. the patient is on warfarin and inr was 1.5 on admission. also of note, the patient had a history of chronic anemia(baseline hgb ___ as well as a recent history of admission for leg laceration requiring transfusion of 2 u prbc. he had been slightly below baseline during this admission, which is likely contributing to his dyspnea. he was treated with pred/azithro/duonebs for his copd exacerbation and was eventually able to be weaned to ra. # chest pain: patient continued to endorse non-radiating, constant chest pain in ___ chest that he has had before with copd exacerbation. the pain is worse with deep breaths. cta negative for pe in ed. trop < 0.01, and ekg consistent with prior without any new ischemic changes. thus, his chest pain is likely attributable to his copd exacerbation. # right calf laceration: sutures were placed on ___ following leg injury, with plan to remove sutures within ___ days. sutures were removed ___. no active bleeding or leakage of fluid from the laceration. the region was tender to palpation. per acs recommendation, it was concluded that debridement would not be necessary. patient currently denying evaluation by wound team. at the time of last

that he is not able to cook for himself and so he mostly just has food delivered. he said that he has frequent falls at home. he had a history of several hospital admissions for management of his chronic conditions and has previously refused forms of home care including ___. per ___ evaluation ___, patient would benefit from discharge to rehab given his instability with walking. patient initially said that he is \"tired of rehabs and does not want to go\". ___ also recommended use of a walker but patient was resistant to this idea. psychiatry was consulted and suggested the possibility of decreasing his home doses of clonazepam, as benzodiazepines increase risks of falls and confusion in the elderly, as well as methadone. however,patient has been on these medications for decades and does not want to decrease the doses at this time. psychiatry also recommends further neuropsych evaluation through ot assessment of cognitive functioning or through cognitive neurology. he refused these evaluations and though he initially said he was open to the idea of rehab and/or ___, he ultimately refused both of these services prior to his discharge. # constipation: patient reported being constipated during his time in the hospital but noted that this was a chronic issue since he was a teenager. he will commonly go ___ weeks without a normal sized bm. he says that a suppository is the only thing that relieves the constipation. he was was put on an aggressive bowel regimen and had a couple small bowel movements. his constipation was most likely attributable to his long-term use of methadone and oxycodone. # incidental possible arteriovenous fistula: ___ done in ed on the day of admission was notable for right common femoral vein demonstrating high velocity flow which is arterialized proximally and appears to be connected to the common femoral artery concerning for an arteriovenous fistula. lower extremity cta was done ___ to further evaluate for the possibility of av fistula and, as above, did not definitively demonstrate av fistula. chronic issues ================== # chronic heart failure (with mildly depressed ef of 45% on last echo): appeared euvolemic with no sign of exacerbation, below his prior dry weights. # history of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis on coumadin: patient is followed by ___ clinic. he recently had been subtherapeutic so was called to increase his dose to 3.5mg ___ and ___, and continue 2.5mg every other day. continued warfarin per home dosing. # depression/post-traumatic stress disorder: continued

heart appears mildly enlarged. the hila appear slightly engorged though there is no frank edema. no large effusion or pneumothorax. no convincing signs of pneumonia. mediastinal contour is unchanged. bony structures are intact. implanted cardiac monitor is seen in the left anterior chest wall as on prior. ___ ct c-spine: alignment is normal. no fractures are identified there is a multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes of the cervical spine and with uncovertebral and facet joint hypertrophy. these changes are worst at c3-4 where bilateral uncovertebral and facet joint hypertrophy cause mild neural foraminal narrowing. there is no significant spinal canal narrowing. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch and bilateral carotid bulbs are noted. thyroid gland is unremarkable. the apices are essentially clear. ___ ct head w/o contrast: there is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or large mass. there is prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggestive of involutional changes. atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid siphons are noted. there is no fracture. the visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. the visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. ___ renal u/s: the right kidney measures 11.7 cm. the left kidney

with past medical history of cad, chf (latest ef 45% ___, copd on 2l oxygen at home intermittently, recurrent blood clots on warfarin iso non-adherence, dvt/pe with thrombosed, irretrievable ivc filter, history of heroin abuse, recent admission for chest pain/dyspnea attributed to copd exacerbation who re-presented after discharge on ___nd a bleeding laceration on his right lower extremity. he quickly stabilized. the medical team continually encouraged the patient to participate in ___ and consider rehab at discharge. he was not amenable to rehab placement but did accept home with ___ services. # chronic ___ edema, skin ulcerations: the patient presented with numerous skin ulcerations on his bilateral lower extremities, and a bleeding laceration on his left lower extremity. there was no evidence of infection on exam. the wound care team managed his lower extremity ulcerations. the chronic venous stasis changes are thought to be secondary to decreased blood return to the right side of the heart from the completely clotted ivc filter. unfortunately, the vascular team evaluated the patient on previous admissions, and they determined that they cannot remove the filter because there is entirely too much clot burden around the filter. # falls: the patient reported frequent falls while at home prior to admission. the etiology of the falls is most likely mechanical. contributing factors were thought to be polypharmacy (high dose opiates, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, etc.) vs. orthostasis as patient presented with markedly decreased po intake and downtrending h/h. patient denied loc, but admitted that he did not entirely remember all of the details. ct head and c-spine were negative for evidence of injury. cxr was without rib fracture. the medical team brought up the topic of decreasing his sedating medicine, and the patient was not amenable to that plan. the medical team continually encouraged the patient to participate in ___ and consider rehab at discharge. he was not amenable to rehab placement but did accept home with ___ services. # ___ on ckd/acute urinary retention: his creatinine on admission was 1.9. this was thought to be pre-renal (secondary to poor po intake and anemia) vs. post-renal (as patient found to be retaining 1l of urine upon arrival to the floor). his ___ improved with iv fluids. his urinary retention was most likely a medication side effect. renal u/s showed no sign of hydronephrosis. ua and urine culture were unremarkable. # acute on chronic anemia: patient with waxing and waning h/h throughout other prior admissions without clear etiology. iron studies from previous hospitalizations were normal, reticulocyte count suggestive of hypoproliferation. this was most likely a combination of chronic disease/iron deficiency/blood loss from oozing leg wounds. during the hospitalization, he also had two episodes of brisk bleeding from his lower extremities, which was controlled with pressure dressings. the patient received a total of 3u prbcs during this hospitalization with appropriate response in hemoglobin after the transfusion. # constipation: patient endorsed a several day hx prior to admission w/o bm, most likely secondary to opiate use. this is a chronic issue that he says has been present since he was a teenager. he said he has bowel movements every ___ weeks. he was continued on home senna, docusate, lactulose bid, bisacodyl suppository prn. chronic issues ============== # chronic diastolic heart failure: the patient presented without evidence of volume overload on exam (other than chronic ___ edema), bnp below recent baseline and cxr without edema. last discharge weight 104.3kg, current weight stable. he was continued on home torsemide and a 2g salt restricted diet. # cad: he was continued on home metoprolol and aspirin. # chronic pain/polysubstance abuse: he was continued on home methadone, gabapentin, clonazepam, and oxycontin. # copd: on ___ at home intermittently. the patient was at baseline o2 saturation and o2 requirement. he was continued on home ipratroptium and albuterol nebulizers prn. #goals of care: multiple conversations were attempted with the patient to explain that his chronic lower extremity bleeding would continue for the rest of his life because of his clotted ivc filter that cannot be removed. it seemed that he was not able to grasp that concept, even after multiple attempts. # hepatitis c: no history of treatment, no cirrhosis on prior imaging but history of hepatic encephalopathy # history of pulmonary embolism: he was continued on home warfarin. # depression/post-traumatic stress disorder: he was continued on home duloxetine and clonazepam. # bph: he was continued on home tamsulosin. transitional issues ================= - a further goals of care discussion would be very beneficial for the patient. he seems to have very poor insight into his condition. - continue pressure dressings on his lower extremities given venous congestion in lower extremities and higher propensity to bleed. # code status: full # contact next of kin: ___ ___ medications on admission: the preadmission medication

___ with no clear localizing symptoms. on presentation to rectal temp of 104, hr 105, bp 103/83, rr 18, 95% on ra. one blood culture was collected, he was given vancomycin, and was admitted to medicine where iv levofloxacin was initially added. rle extremity noted to have severe chronic stasis dermatitis with emacirated bleeding skin erosions. ct of rle was obtained which did not show any evidence soft tissue infection or abscess. ct head was non acute and cxr was noted for stable cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion. admitted to the floor and started on empiric abx with ceftriaxone, flagyl and vanco. did not have any more fever spikes. started weaning off abx on ___ by stopping flagyl and ceftriaxone. dermatology was consulted and felt that his skin lesions were c/w acroangiodermatitis related to his venous stasis; the mainstay of treatment is compression with which the patient has initially not been amenable to. on ___, pt triggered for hypotension with hct drop down to 17.2 and transferred to the ficu where he received prbc x7. hemolysis labs were negative as were stool guiacs and his hct eventually stabilized. the only known source of bleeding was his leg which had somewhat increased bleeding that morning in the setting of therputic sq lovenox. he did not undergo any further evaluation for occult bleed. lovenox was held. given his hypotension and some hypoxia he was evaluated and ruled out for mi per trops neg x2 and tte in the ficu showed lvef 50-55 w/o wma. he was continued on iv vancomycin and resumed on his home torsamide given intermittent ___ o2 requirement. picc was placed and cxr showed cleared lung fields. he remained afebrile and antibiotics were not expanded. he did not require presors. he was transferred back to the medical floor in stable condition on ___. iv vanco held on ___. continued management for bleeding leg ulcers and had intermittent prbc requirements for low hct. ct abd/pelvis non-con ___ did not show any other obvious site of bleeding. here are the following issues addressed during his stay: - fever: single spike on admission thus far rle only potential source identified, ? portal for bacteremia though bcx ntd. initially on iv vanco + levofloxacin, switched to iv ceftriaxone + po mtronidazole subsequently as bcx ntd and afebrile stopped iv ceftriaxone + flagyl (last doses ___ and continued iv vanco. iv vanco held on ___ after completion of 8 day course. no further abx given blood cultures were negative and fevers never recurred. the suspicion for cellulitis in his leg was low from the outset - acute on chronic blood loss anemia: requiring 7 blood transfusions on ___. likely ___ to blood loss from bleeding rle wounds. ct abd/pelvis non-con ___ did not show any other obvious site of bleeding. however does report some brbpr and very likely to have colonic varrices/hemmoroids. the degree of anemia and prbc requirement (10 units thus far during this admission) suggested that beyond his legs wound there may be another ongoing source of slow blood loss which is most likely to be in his lower gi tract. he was reviewed by gastroenterology consult who ultimately decided to do egd/colonoscopy. due to the large fecal load, he required several days of preparation. the egd showed signs of linear erosion with oozing (endoclipped) - and gastritis. colonoscopy was unremarkable although could not reach cecum. a ctc virtual colonography revealed no suspicious lesions. for this bleed, mr. ___ was placed on ppi bid. hpylori serologies and stool ag were pending on dc but treatment is recommended if serology is positive. - severe macerated stasis dermatitis of lower extremities: bleeding skin lesions c/w acroangiodermatitis related to his venous stasis. warfarin and sq lovenox continue to be held given ongoing bleeding. sq heparin was trialed and caused significantly worsened bleeding and was held again on ___ with subsequent improvement. he was reviewed by dermatology and per their recs underwent intensive wound care with vaseline impregnated gauze or adaptic covered by absorptive dressing covered by kerlix as well as compressive ace raps and elevation for bilateral lower extremities. compression is considered to be the mainstay of treatment for his underlying skin condition. - chronic vte/thrombosis/embolism risk: discussed with hematology consult and vascular surgery given his high risk of dvt and embolism in the setting of holding of anticoagulation and an in-situ old ivc filter which is likely not protecting him from pe anymore and can even serve as a nidus for a down stream clot. per vascular there are no available surgical interventions for his venous stasis and the ivc filter can not be safely removed. hematology team agreed that anticoagulation be held initially. after the gastric bleed was identified and treated, mr. ___ was placed back on anticoagulation with heparin gtt sliding scale. he was stable for >48hrs on iv heparin and warfarin was resumed with goal inr ___. on discharge he is to be transitioned to lovenox ___ q12 as a bridge to warfarin until inr >2. please given lovenox upon arrival to the facility and dose from there. please check inr again on ___. - hypotension: likely ___ to fluid shifts and unstable intravascular volume due to bleeding and torsamide. these responded to fluid boluses and prbc transfusion and resolved with holding of home torsamide and anticoagulation. his torsemide was resumed on dc but his lisinopril continues to be held. this can be re-evaluated in the future - constipation: managed with agresive bowl regimen and enemas. - ___. bland ua except for elevated sg. resolved with ivf - elevated lactate, low bp's, ___: ? low circulating volume in the setting of sirs. resolved - mild pulmonary congestion and hypoxia in the setting of being off his home torsamide. resolved. - long standing pancytopenia: b12, folate, ferritin checked during this admission and not low. - known splenomegaly: no obvious cirrhosis on . abdominal ct ___ showed splenomegaly. liver was unremarkable. stable - h/o recurrent falls and poor functional status - chronic pain syndrome/opiates: on mmt for years, but it appears that ___ rehab is tapering him down; his dose was 60 mg daily which he tolerated well per rehab nursing and records. until ___, the patient was on oxycontin 40 mg tid for his chronic pain. it appears that this has been stopped at some point during his recent hospitalizations and rehab stays. has not visited his ___ clinic since ___. during this admission he was ultimately placed on methadone 85 mg day for his aute on chronic pain (leg and abdomen). no additional opiates are needed otherwise at this baseline. - his methadone is currently for chronic pain at the dose recommended. can wean as tolerated - social issues: until recently, the patient has lived alone where he is somewhat unsafe and often falls. he has frequent hospitalizations, partially caused by failures of self-care for his multiple chronic illnesses. however, he has fairly bad ptsd and an independent spirit, so he likes being left alone and usually refuses any rehab placements or skilled home care. recently he has been in ___ rehab. patient has previously declined to complete an hcp as he has no friends or relatives involved in his care. chronic: -ptsd - cad s/p stemi (w/bms in lad

subsequently demonstrated a developing pneumonia. patient initially on unasyn for broad coverage given subsequent persistent fever and progressive hypoxia with intermittent blood streaked sputum (thought to be from pneumonia and anticoagulation as admission chest imaging did not show other potential causes). antibiotics were transitioned to vancomycin and levaquin, with subsequent slow improvement in respiratory status over several days. slow improvement felt to relate to his significant underlying lung disease. he was able to be weaned to home ra to 2lnc and completed an 8 day course of levofloxacin. would repeat chest ct in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of pneumonia--could consider repeating sooner if hemoptysis were to persist. continued tiotropium, nebulizers. patient

productive cough. pt required brief icu stay and was started on nocturnal bipap. tte this admission showed interval worsening of phtn with now moderate phtn and worsening tr and mr, which is also likely contributing to his hypoxia and made worse by possible underlying central hypoventilation. at baseline, pt at 2l nocturnal o2. while pt has been intermittently refusing his torsemide, he does not have significant evidence of pulmonary edema on cxr with lower bnp than prior and his hypoxia has actually improved. this makes chf exacerbation less likely. s/p doxy for copd flare. initiated

the cervical spine. within the thoracic spine, there are metastatic lesions involving the posterior vertebral body and the posterior elements at t7 and t8. there is substantial epidural disease at t7 which encases and displaces the cord anteriorly with mild compression. there is no abnormal cord signal at this time. there is a metastatic lesion involving the t5 vertebral body on the right. bilateral pleural effusions are seen. evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates multilevel spondylosis. no definite metastatic lesions seen. left kidney is not visualized and may have been

distant metastasis. large stool in the rectosigmoid region. brief hospital course: 1. ams: per discussion with daughter, patient has had progressive dementia for months, although daughter was not present to comment on deviation from baseline. her superimposed delirium and agitation were likely from benzo withdrawal, as she was not initially continued on her outpatient standing lorazepam (med list wasn't yet available). with addition of this, and 1mg po haldol at night, she continued to be confused, although was much more calm and had no further agitation. her delirium was also managed with pain control (she had very little pain during the admission, though) and frequent reorientation and reassurance. infectious workup was negative. she had a brain mri to rule out cva or metastatic disease, and this was negative. 2. lytic spine lesion: seen in t5, t7, t8. also seen was a mass surrounding the spinal cord with mild anterior spinal cord compression, although with a normal neuro exam. she underwent 3 sessions of xrt during this admission, and will continue xrt on ___ and ___ at 2pm to complete a total of 5 sessions. it remains unclear if her lesions are metastatic renal carcinoma or a new primary, as her renal cell cancer was last treated ___ years ago. ct abdomen/pelvis was done to search for a primary, or find a site amenable to biopsy as xrt made vertebral biopsy not possible. tumor markers were also sent, but not suggestive of a specific diagnosis. after discussion with the patient's daughter ___ (to whom the patient deferred all medical decisions due to her

abnormality at dome of the liver is not visualized on mri. the liver enhances homogeneously and there is no evidence of focal mass or infarction brief hospital course: brief hospital course: ___ female patient with a history of ___ disease (restarted on ___ ___ for new flare) who came to the ed for abdominal pain since the morning of ___ concerning for acute-on-chronic ___ flare, found to have colitis on ct and leukocytosis to 27, and admitted for workup and iv antibiotics. gi was consulted and followed the patient throughout the hospitalization. it was believed the abdominal pain came about secondary to constipation and abdominal distention. the patient was given an aggressive bowel regimen, which helped the symptoms which we believe were secondary to a previous botox injection for pelvic floor disfunction. the patient also received her second loading dose of humira while in the hospital and was started on a course of steroids (initially iv to po prednisone). her abdominal pain and distension continued to improve and was at baseline at discharge. throughout the hospitalization, the patient also had continued hypoxia, which was something she had experienced at a recent hospitalization at ___, but without any clear reason. the patient required ___ of oxygen for the first half of her stay to remain in the low ___ on her o2 stat and would desat into the high ___ and low ___ during ambulation. outside records could not be gathered regarding any hypoxia. it was believe this was caused by a raised right hemidiaphragm causing low lung volumes, atlectosis from laying in bed, and blunting secondary to abdominal pain. the patient was also found to have a pneumonia (cap) which was treated for 5 days with levaquin. ultimately, once the patient began ambulating and her abdominal pain improved she was able to come of all o2 without difficulty and did not require home oxygen. the patient was also found to have leukocytosis on admission which reached a nadir of 10 during the middle of the hospitalization when the patient felt well, however began to rise without a clear cause. the wbc went up to 23.9 and stabilized around this value, and although the patient had been started on steroids, was a suspicious rise in the context of her clinical picture. a blood smear was obtained which showed inflammation, b12 deficiency, and some questionable mds type cells. the patients b12 was found to be low at 224, but an mma was not obtained as it an outpatient lab. to evaluate for other potential causes of leukocytosis, a ct abdomin/pelvis was done to evaluate for potential abscess/occult infection, and revealed a wedge-shaped infarct in a peripheral region of her liver. to further classify this and to look for any local process which could have contributed, a mri liver was done which did not demonstrate the lesion and heme/onc did not recommend anticoagulation. the patient was discharged home in stable condition. ======================= transitional issues: ======================= []check cbc in 1 week to evaluate improving leukocytosis. if continues to be elevated, consider heme/onc referral for possible bone marrow biopsy for mds ___ []vitamin b12 was deficient. will replete b12 and folate. consider follow-up with methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine levels []patient had severe constipation and on numerous anticholinergeric medications.

polysubstance misuse, acute major mood episode, social stressors in terms of housing. we modified this risk by helping patient to set up methadone program and encouraging patient to talk to outpatient providers about her opioid addiction. protective factors include: -protective factors include current outpatient providers/treatment, strong connections to family and community support, and skills in problem solving. current risk is low/moderate for intentional self-harm given that pt denies suicidal ideation, intent and plan, is accepting of treatment, is currently sober and is future oriented

arm pain and tingling. an mri of your brain did not show any concerning findings, and a lumbar puncture did not show signs of inflammation of the nervous system. an mri of your neck showed mild narrowing of the area around your spinal cord, which may be responsible for your arm and leg symptoms. your headache may also have been due to this narrowing. to help with your headache, you may use a soft cervical collar at nighttime. you were also prescribed a medication (gabapentin) to take at night to help with your arm and leg pain and tingling. you also received a prescription for fioricet, a medication that you can take occasionally to stop severe headaches. aside from your spine narrowing, you also experienced a different headache and nausea that was likely related to your lumbar puncture. a blood patch was placed by anesthesiology to help relieve the fluid leakage that led to this headache. you received a prescription for a nausea medication (ondansetron) to take if needed.

gabapentin was also initiated to relieve paresthesias, with plan for titration by patient's outpatient neurologist. fioricet was prescribed for as-needed use in the interim, which patient has been taking since discharge as prescribed. since discharge on ___, patient has had a constellation of neurologic symptoms. on ___, in the evening following discharge, she reported an ongoing headache, consistent with her semiology described during admission. it was severe, but improved after taking her gabapentin and fiorcet, and she was able to sleep through the night. on that evening, however, she did find out the unfortunate news that a family friend had passed away (her aunt's daughter), whom ms. ___ was very close to. this family friend had been ill for some time, so the death was not unexpected. however, it was especially distressing to her because her aunt did not contact anyone about the death, and she felt like it was being concealed. when the patient woke up on ___, her headache head improved. her husband notes that her walk was somewhat unsteady at that time but the patient denied it, and was still able to walk household distances without falling or needing to hold onto objects. in the late afternoon, she began to have several new issues: 1) episodes of right arm tremor and higher amplitude movements. her husband recorded this on video, which i reviewed. it consisted of non-rhythmic movements of the right arm, irregular in frequency, with maintained alertness. at times it appeared more like a right arm tremor and at other times it was more like nonrhythmic shaking. patient reports that during this event, she was fully alert and aware of her arm doing it. she could suppress the movements somewhat if she concentrated, and her sister could suppress them with touching. duration lasted anywhere from a few minutes to 10 minutes or more. she had several episodes of this over the course of the evening. 2) episodes of right face \"spasm.\" also recorded on video, this consisted of twitching of the right lower face, intermixed with puckering of the lip. this appears somewhat like right hemifacial spasm versus tardative dyskinesias (though it only affects the right side of the face). as with episode #1 above, could last anywhere from a few minutes to 10 minutes or more. 3) episodes of \"word finding\" difficulty. patient had periods when she seemed to have difficulty expressing herself, lasting for only a few seconds at a time (never more than this). for example, when her husband asked her if she wanted to go outside to get some fresh air, she said \"lets go oo--\" and unable to finish saying \"out.\" they cannot think of any other examples of this. she had no difficulties understanding speech and still could express a few words. sometimes when she seemed to think of a word, her eyes would \"roll back\" for a second or two. she otherwise was at her baseline. she contacted her dr. ___ who recommended that she return to the emergency department for further evaluation, but patient declined. as these events occurred overnight, the patient woke up today (___) with no further episodes of semiologies 1 and 2. she woke up and her headache had resumed. she went to lie down and took a nap until 1:30pm. when she woke up at 1:30pm, she reported feeling \"a heavy depression.\" she said she felt sad, though not at any one particular thing, which her husband says is typical for her. she did not mention anything about the recent passing of the family friend. she called her husband on the phone (who works as a ___ and was at work) and appeared \"emotionally labile.\" husband notes that she would alternate between having a \"baby voice\" and seeming juvenile, to crying and shouting. she was making sense while talking, and discussed her headaches. he was concerned and soon went back home, where he found her sitting on the swing, talking to ems. currently, patient reports she feels back to her baseline apart from ___ headache, and is anxious to be discharged from ed to go back home. her husband notes that she still is off from her baseline, intermittently with emotional lability and \"not quite with it.\" past medical history: cervicogenic headaches s/p recent epidural patch for ?spinal headache gastritis chronic constipation social history: ___ family history: mother with ischemic stroke at age ___. physical exam: admission exam vitals: t 98.6f, hr 90, bp 136/90, rr 22, o2 99% ra general: awake, cooperative, nad. heent: nc/at, no scleral icterus noted, mmm, no lesions noted in oropharynx neck: supple, no nuchal rigidity pulmonary: breathing non labored on room air cardiac: warm and well perfused;

consideration was also given to underlying conversion disorder or histrionic personality disorder. recommendations included discontinuation of gabapentin, initiation of clonazepam as bridging therapy to outpatient psychiatric care, and referral for an outpatient psychiatric provider. a referral number was provided to the patient for an outpatient psychiatry np with intake planned for within one week of discharge. in addition to the above changes, as-needed sumatriptan was prescribed for migraine headaches, with as-needed lorazepam for severe panic episodes not responding to reassurance and redirection (which patient's husband and family have been comfortably able to provide at home). as noted above, these medications will need to be reviewed by patient's outpatient psychiatry provider on ___. neurology ___ was maintained as scheduled, with recommendation for pcp ___ in one week. medications on admission: 1. acetaminophen-caff-butalbital 1 tab po q6h:prn headache 2. gabapentin 100 mg po qhs 3. ondansetron odt 4 mg po q8h:prn nausea 4. bisacodyl ___ mg po qhs 5. omeprazole 20 mg po daily 6. psyllium powder 1 pkt po qhs 7. tretinoin 0.05% cream 1 appl tp qhs discharge medications: 1. clonazepam 0.5 mg po bid duration: 7 days do not drive or operate heavy machinery on this medication. rx *clonazepam 0.5 mg 1 (one) tablet(s) by mouth twice a day disp #*14 tablet refills:*0 2. lorazepam 0.5 mg po q8h:prn severe panic attacks duration: 7 days do not drive or operate heavy machinery while on this medication. rx *lorazepam 0.5 mg 1 (one) by mouth every eight (8) hours disp #*14 tablet refills:*0 3. sumatriptan succinate 25 mg po q6h:prn migraine headache duration: 7 days ___ take a second dose if no relief after 2 hours. no more than 8 doses per day. rx *sumatriptan succinate 25 mg 1 (one) tablet(s) by mouth every six (6) hours disp #*28 tablet refills:*0 4. acetaminophen-caff-butalbital 1 tab po q6h:prn headache 5. bisacodyl ___ mg po qhs 6. omeprazole 20 mg po daily 7. ondansetron odt 4 mg po q8h:prn nausea 8. psyllium powder 1 pkt po qhs 9. tretinoin 0.05% cream 1 appl tp qhs discharge disposition: home discharge diagnosis: mood disorder, not otherwise specified. discharge condition: mental status: clear and coherent. level of consciousness: alert and interactive. activity status: ambulatory - independent. discharge instructions: dear ms. ___, you were admitted to ___ for evaluation of right arm movements, right facial twitching, and stuttering speech for two days. a ct scan of your head did not show signs of a new stroke, and your neurologic examination remained stable without new concerning findings. you were seen by the psychiatry service, who felt that your symptoms were due to a mood disorder and possibly panic attacks. they recommended stopping one of your medications (gabapentin) and starting a new medication (clonazepam) to manage your anxiety;

please see below for full details. please do not hesitate to return to the emergency department if you again have suicidal feelings. followup instructions: ___ "

radiograph below the diaphragm. the lungs are well expanded; however, there is minimal bibasilar atelectasis evident. the mediastinum is unremarkable. the cardiac silhouette is stable, accounting for patient and technical factors. no effusion or pneumothorax is evident. the visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. . ___ u/s ___ findings: this was a limited doppler evaluation of the tips stent. again demonstrated in the right hepatic lobe is a tips stent catheter, which appears unchanged in position. color doppler evaluation shows wall-to-wall color doppler signal within the tips stent. flow velocities within the tips stent in the proximal, mid, and distal portions are 127, 173, and 175 cm/sec respectively. overall, these are in similar range to the prior studies of ___ and ___. there is appropriate hepatopetal blood flow in the main portal vein. as before, no definite flow is identified within the left portal vein. impression: patent tips stent with flow velocities within similar range to recent evaluations. . small bowel follow-through ___: no evidence of mechanical obstruction. fecalization of the small bowel consistent with slowly resolving small bowel obstruction. small bowel fold thickening likely related to resolving obstruction and chronic liver disease. r heart cath ___: 1. normal right sided filling pressures. 2. mild pulmonary artery hypertension. 3. preservec cardiac index. . echo ___: the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. there is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is no pericardial effusion. ef 40-45%, diastolic dysfunction. . eeg ___: markedly abnormal portable eeg due to the low voltage slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing. these findings indicate a moderately severe encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical functions. medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes. there were no areas of prominent focal abnormalities, and there were no epileptiform features. . egd ___ varices at the lower third of the esophagus grade 3 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction (biopsy) food in the whole stomach granularity, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy . ___ liver biopsy: 1. focal, mild portal and minimal lobular, predominantly mononuclear inflammation with admixed eosinophils and a rare neutrophil. 2. a rare portal, non-necrotizing granuloma identified. 3. bile ducts with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized. 4. no steatosis or intracytoplasmic hyalin. 5. mild increased portal fibrosis with foci of sinusoidal fibrosis on trichrome stain (interpreted as stage 1 fibrosis). 6. no iron deposition on iron stain. note: the features are consistent with involvement by the patient's previously diagnosed hepatic sarcoidosis. the presence of focal sinusoidal fibrosis raises the possibility of a prior toxic/metabolic injury. a reticulin stain will be performed and the results reported in an addendum. . brief hospital course: ms. ___ is a ___ w/ esld most likely from sarcoid s/p tips, severe portal gastropathy, grade ii esoph varices, cardiomyopathy w/ ef 40% and diastolic dysfunction admitted to micu for ams ___ likely hepatic encephalopathy and possible med non-compliance, treated with lactulose with marked improvement. 1) altered mental status: extensive possible differential diagnosis but most likely etiology is continued suboptimal lactulose compliance vs subtherapeutic lactulose dose at home and resulting hepatic encephalopathy. this is especially likely given her improving mental status after only 2 doses of lactulose. cxr w/o pathology, pt remained afebrile with mild left shift, u/a without e/o infection. sbp unlikely given no abdominal symptoms and minimal ascites. recurrent hospitalizations after her tips procedure also indicate tips may be cause of her worsening encephalopathy. she was evaluated by interventional radiology for a tips reduction however the procedure was not completed as there was good portal flow across the liver. she did have a transjugular liver biopsy by ___, results were pending at time of discharge. she will follow up with dr. ___ in clinic. 2) anemia: baseline hct low ___. she has significant bleeding risks from varices, gastropathy and colonic/gastric avms and is likely slowly oozing. she has required transfusions in past however did not require transfusion during this admission. guaiac negative stools in-house, no e/o hematemesis or hematochezia at this time. she was continued on nadolol and lactulose. hematocrit was 32.2 on discharge. 3) sarcoidosis: liver and pulmonary involvement resulting in pulmonary hypertension and varices. complicated by several variceal bleeds resulting in tips placement. she was continued on her home prednisone dosage. 4) portal hypertension and gastropathy: secondary to sarcoidosis as above and resulting in tips placement. she continued her ppi and nadolol. 5)partial small-bowel obstruction: pt with normal small bowel follow-through ___ and had several episodes of vomiting and abdominal x-ray showed evidence of small-bowel obstruction which resolved with bowel regimen. she continued to take po's without problem and was having ___ bowel movements per day and was free of abdominal pain/nausea on discharge. she was given a rx for enemas which she can use if she is constipated despite taking lactulose as this worked well for her during her hospitalization. 6) chf: chronic stable moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be related to her sarcoidosis. no current signs of fluid overload on exam as basilar crackles likely ___ atelectasis. 7) copd: pfts stable over past ___ years and not requiring home oxygen therapy. she received prn nebulizer treatments. 8) hypothyroidism: continue synthroid 9) h/o rsd s/p

been exacerbated. she states compliance with medications, though has had difficulty with noncompliance in the past. discussion with her husband reveals that she has been taking lactulose once daily and perhaps this is not sufficient for her. there was no evidence of tips obstruction on u/s. no ascites to tap for sbp. hct stable and no brbrp or evidence of gib given guaiac negative. no fevers, dysuria, or abdominal pain to suggest infectious source. on admission she did have acute renal failure that appeared related to diuretic use, that may have contributed. u tox/serum tox negative. she readily improved with increased lactulose administration. she was continued on flagyl, thiamine and folic acid as well. 2 acute renal failure: creatinine was elevated to 1.4 from baseline 0.9 on admission. this was thought possibly secondary to diuretic use (spironolactone and lasix) and supported by feurea that was prerenal. the diuretics were held and she was given gentle ivf and her renal failure improved. she was started on lower doses of spironolactone and lasix on discharge, and was ordered for repeat renal function and electrolytes for 5 days after discharge. 3 sarcoidosis: liver and pulmonary involvement resulting in pulmonary hypertension, cirrhosis and varices. she was continued on home prednisone. 4 ecg changes: minimally changed from baseline ekg. completely asymptomatic, low suspicion for acs or demand ischemia. she completed a rule out by cardiac enzymes, which were negative and she was monitored on telemetry with no events during this. 5 congestive heart failure: chronic stable moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be related to her sarcoidosis. no symptoms or signs of fluid overload were noted during her

cecum and terminal ileus or tethered together in the right lower quadrant likely secondary to adhesions. 3. ground-glass changes in the lungs bilaterally, possibly due to pulmonary edema. 4. emphysematous changes in the lungs consistent with stated diagnosis of copd. cxr (___): impression: atelectasis left lower lobe. cxr (___): findings: in comparison with the study earlier in this date, there is some prominence of interstitial markings with kerley lines, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. poor definition of the retrocardiac region raises the possibility of some atelectatic change at the base. blunting of the costophrenic angles could be a manifestation of pleural fluid. cxr (___): findings: in comparison with the sequence of previous films from earlier in this month, there has been clearing of the left pleural effusion. cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. prominence of interstitial markings may reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both. no acute focal pneumonia. brief hospital course: 1) small bowel obstruction  ct from ___ showed a transition point in the mid-distal ileum and no ascites. surgery was consulted and an ng was placed with return of 1.5l of bilious fluid. sbo thought to be likely due to adhesions, possibly related to sarcoidosis. she was intubated for airway protection and a left subclavian cvc was placed for access. the ng tube had >1l output for first ___ days. output then decreased and stools picked up so the ng tube was removed. she was extubated on ___ and had a picc placed for tpn on ___. her diet was slowly advanced and the tpn was weaned. at discharge she was tolerating a regular diet and was moving her bowels. 2) anemia  acute normocytic anemia. initial hematocrit of 41 was likely due to dehydration as her baseline is in the mid ___. her hematocrit trended down to 22.9 with stool guaiac negative on multiple occasions. she also had negative hemolysis labs. she was transfused 1 u prbcs on ___ and about 1 hour later developed acute pulmonary edema with sbp 200 and hr 130. she received lasix 40mg iv and her symptoms and vitals rapidly improved with a 1l output. the blood bank was notified due to the possiblity of trali. her hematocrit rise was appropriate and remained in the mid ___. 3) hepatic sarcoidosis: complicated by recurrent encephalopathy, patient status post tips and revision. her platelets remained stable with negative hit antibodies. her encephalopathy improved rapidly following lactulose. her tips was found to be occluded, but revision was not done due to concern that it would worsen her encephalopathy. she also initially received empiric flagyl to prevent bacterial translocation, but this was deemed unnecessary and discontinued. she was continued on her home ursodiol, ppi, and vitamins/minerals. she was initially on hydrocortisone while npo, but switched to her outpatient prednisone before discharge. she was also restarted on her sucralfate, furosemide, and spironolactone at discharge. her amitriptyline and zolpidem were held due to her encephalopathy and may be restarted as an outpatient if appropriate. 3) pneumonia  on ___, she spiked to 101.7 and there was concern for an infiltrate on cxr. etiology aspiration versus vap. she was started on vanc/zosyn, narrowed to zosyn, and was subsequently afebrile and without leukocytosis. she completed a 7 day course of antibiotics prior to discharge. 4) arf  her bun and cr were elevated on admission to 46 and 2.2, respectively, up from baseline bun ___ and baseline cr 0.8-1.0. she was given iv lr for prerenal azotemia and her furosemide and spironolactone were held. she was also noted to have a gbs uti and was orinigally given pen g, but it was

non-radiating pain, ___. there was no associated nausea or vomitting. she did report a decrease in her usual number of bowel movements (none for 12 hours). she had an ultrasound and a ct scan of the abdomen with po contrast to assess for small bowel obstruction or ascites. there was no ascites, but a likely early or partial sbo was demonstrated. there was no evidence of ischemia or pneumatosis. she was hemodynamically stable. given that she could not have an ng tube place because of her recent endoscopic procedure, conservative management including npo, lactulose enemas, and serial abdominal exams was undertaken. the surgery team evaluated her and agreed with this plan. on the morning of hospital day #3, the patient again began having bowel movements, and her pain resolved. clear liquids were begun and slowly advanced to a regular diet, which she tolerated well. . acute renal failure: creatinine was elevated from baseline of 1.0 to 1.3. she was given 2l ns ivf for possible prerenal etiology. diuretics were held initially. creatinine returned to baseline. outpatient diuretic regiment was restarted. . hepatic sarcoidosis: she was noted to be s/p tips x 2 with spontaneous clotting of the tips. she was continued on ursodiol and prednisone and was given benadryl for itching. lfts were stable, with baseline elevated alkaline phosphatase. lactulose was continued and titrated to 3 bms/day. no consideration was given to recanalize the tips ___ prior severe episodes of he. . cough: the patient complained of a cough, runny nose, and sore throat on hospital day #3. cxr was negative

summarized by surgical and medical services mrs. ___ is a ___ yo female with with history of elsd from hepatic sarcoid who initially presented on ___ w/ small bowel obstruction and had hospital course complicated by arf, status epilepticus, secondary bacterial peritonitis, and hepatic encephalopathy. brief hospital course by problem small bowel obstruction the patient was admitted to ___ with nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. given her history of hepatic sarcoidsis, the patient underwent ct of abd/pelvis revealing a transition point in rlq pelvis with fecalization of sb proximal to this pt. of note, prior ct on ___ had revealed cirrhosis and portal htn with tips shunt occluded. the patient was thus taken to the or on ___ where she underwent exploratory laparotomy with enterotomy and lysis of adhesions. intraoperatively she was found to have some adhesions with dilated loops of bowel but no transition point; the small bowel was dilated to the extent that an enterotomy was required in order to decompress the bowel and close the abdomen. she also had a cvl placed in the or. she was kept intubated overnight and brought to the icu. she was weaned to extubated in the am. she received perioperative antibiotics and stress dose steroids postoperatively. esophageal varices/anemia/portal gastropathy she also had an egd on ___ that revealed 3 nonbleeding grade 2 varices in distal esophagus and portal hypertension gastritis w small blood clot in stomach; no active bleeding. she had a relatively stable anemia that trended down around ___ that was thought to be morst likely secondary to slow ooze from portal gastropathy. she was transfused 2 units prbc ___, 1 unit ___ with subsequent stabilization of hct. varices were banded on day of discharge and she was started on sucralfate for 10 days. postoperative ileus on ___ she was transferred to the floor, her ngt was discontinued, and she was started on sips, which she tolerated well. on ___ she was noticed to be increasingly tender without bowel movements; kub revealed persistent dilated small-bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels concerning for persistent small-bowel obstruction or post-operative ileus. her ngt was replaced. she was started empirically on unasyn. acute renal failure while on surgical service, the patient was also noted to have an increase in her creatinine from 1.3 to 2.2; this was thought secondary to large fluid losses from her jp drain in her abdomen; she was started on replacements ___ cc/cc with improvement in her creatinine to 1.2 on ___. she had a picc placed on ___ and was started on tpn. she again developed a rise in her creatinine on ___. she was given albumin 62.5g on ___ and bicarb and blood on ___ for volume rescusitation. urine microscopy showed granular and hyaline cast. urine lytes were not consistent with pre-renal but renal felt this was a pre-renal/evolving atn picture. she has a mixed non-gap and gap acidosis. the gap is likely from the renal failure and the non-gap from her diarrhea. the bicarb has improved her acid-base status and lactulose was stopped to slow down the diarrhea. creatinine trended down prior to discharge. diuretics were held. hepatic encephalopathy on the floor the patient was noticed to be increasingly less talkative with a dull affect, thought to be consistent with past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. she was given high dose lactulose pr with initial improvement in her mental status. secondary bacterial peritonitis the patient had been improving, and so her ngt was discontinued. unfortunately, she then developed increasing abdominal pain; on ___ she underwent repeat ct scan of abd/pelvis that revealed persistent dilation of multiple loops of small bowel with wall thickening and mesenteric edema without a definitive transition point concerning for a mixed mechanical and functional obstruction, a cirrhotic liver with tips and portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, and diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. the jp drain fluid was sent for analysis; klebsiella oxytoca and ___ grew out from the fluid both on ___ and ___. infectious disease was consulted; the patient was started on zosyn for the klebsiella and caspofungin for the ___. the zosyn was eventually changed to cefepime on ___ given the sensitivities. cefepime was later changed to meropenem due to concern for precipitating seizure. her home gabapentin and amitriptyline were held given their potential muscarinic effects on peristalsis. the patient had been having low-grade fevers in the setting of steroids but no mental status changes at the time. she was thought to have infected peritoneal fluid possibly secondary to the enterotomy, though the etiology is not completely clear. serial paracenteses were performed until pt no longer had evidence of bacterial peritonitis with <250 polys in ascitic fluid. she was continued on antibiotics for two week course after jp pulled to complete ___. the patient's abdominal exam gradually improved, her ngt was discontinued on ___, and she was started on a regular diet given that she was passing gas and having bowel movements. that said, the patient continued to have low-grade fevers throughout even though she was still on steroids (tapered to her home dose from admission) and multiple antibiotics. because of her improved exam, decreased output from her jp and the thought that her fluid status could be better managed with the drain out, her jp drain was removed. she did have some tenederness on abdominal exam on ___, and so she underwent another ct scan that revealed increased ascites compared to prior study but no focal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation. the patient did have diffuse anasarca and mesenteric edema; the small bowel was mildly dilated with mild bowel wall thickening, decreased since prior study, and there was no pneumatosis or free air. hypernatremia the patient also became hypernatremic to a high of 154 on ___ was started on free water replacements), likely intravascularly depleted given her high bun, and hyperchloremic with a low bicarbonate; the later two likely secondary to previous normal saline/tpn loads. given her stable vital signs, she was transferred to the floor on ___, though she still remains with altered mental status further discuused below. altered mental status on ___ the patient was noted to be increasingly abulic, though paranoid appearing. she was transferred to the sicu. she underwent an abd u/s on ___ that revealed scant ascites, patent vasculature, and biliary dilatation. given the results the patient did not undergo paracentesis even though this was one possible etiology for her ams. both psychiatry (who had previously been following the patient for depression) and neurology were consulted. her mental status waxed and waned with occasional episodes of increased awareness and pronouncing her name. her altered mental status was initially thought to be due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy ___ liver disease, infection, and underlying brain disease. her eeg on ___ was consistent with this and negative for seizure per neurology although there was a questionable focus in the frontal lobe. lp and mri/a were performed and were both negative on ___. ng tube was pulled out on ___ and put back in ___ and patient was treated with lactulose with stool outputs of a liter per day. patient had paracentesis ___ with reduction in white cells but persistent bacterial peritonitis and gram negative rods on gram stain. on ___, per id, metronidazole was added to cover anerobes. patient had been on cefepime for klebsiella and caspofungin for ___ ___ since her initial tap. she completed 2 week course (after jp pulled) with change of antibiotics to meropenem (then ertapenem at discharge for once daily dosing) and caspo. status epilepticus on the morning of ___ she was noted to be \"twitching\". her glucose and electrolytes were wnl. neurology was contacted and initially did not think this was seizure activity but eeg was ordered to r/o myoclonic seizure. eeg demonstrated status epilepticus. she was given 2 mg iv ativan and this resolved. she was loaded with fosphenytoin and continued on fosphenytoin with daily monitoring of levels. it was unclear what precipitaed seizures but may have been form underlying brain disease (h/o cva), hepatic encephalopathy, or med effect. flagyl was discontinued and cefeoime changed to ___. she was transferred to micu fo closer monitoring. ekg and cxr were wnl during this episode. when her mental status remained altered after being on therapeutic dilantin, she was started on keppra in addition to dilantin. mental status subsequently continued to improve and she became awake, oriented and conversant. she was started on a regular diet and started working with physical therapy and was discharged to home with services. hypothyroidism continued on levothroxine. tsh wnl. code full medications on admission: albuterol

view, there are several differential air-fluid levels demonstrated. gas is demonstrated within the colon, which is not distended. a post-pyloric feeding tube is seen with the tip of the feeding tube likely within the jejunum. a tips is seen within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. the osseous structures are unremarkable. impression: findings suggestive of early or partial small-bowel obstruction. feeding tube within the post-pyloric position. . mr 3d rendering w/post processing on independent ___ study date of ___ 11:18 am findings: again seen is moderate distention of the small bowel. there is also some fluid distention of the right colon. the small bowel is mildly thick-walled. there is moderate edema within the right colonic wall. on the post-contrast images, there is moderate enhancement of the mucosa in these regions. there is no obvious transition seen in the bowel dilatation. overall, given that the patient has portal hypertension, the findings are most likely secondary to that. no evidence to suggest crohn's disease. no abscess or fistula is identified. a nasoduodenal tube is present. foley catheter in the bladder. 2-mm cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney. the liver appears nodular. it is only partially imaged. partially imaged spleen is at least 15 cm in length. there is a small amount of ascites. tips shunt is seen extending from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. the inferior mesenteric vein is distended. on the t2 fat-saturated images, there is heterogeneous marrow signal intensity seen in the medial aspect of the left femoral head. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations delineated the dynamic series with multiple perspectives. impression: 1. findings of cirrhosis with ascites and splenomegaly. tips shunt is noted. 2. dilated small bowel, probably due to ileus. there is edema in the right colon, which is probably due to portal hypertension. 3. there is increased signal intensity seen on the t2-weighted images in medial aspect of the left femoral head. this is nonspecific. if the patient does not have hip pain, the findings could be due to bone marrow edema from arthritis. the patient appears to have an osteophyte extending from the posterior acetabulum. if the patient does have hip pain, recommend ct to exclude fracture in the hip. . chest (portable ap) study date of ___ 11:33 am chest, ap upright portable: a right ij central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. a nasogastric tube terminates in the distal portion of the stomach. a new nasojejunal feeding tube, placed since the film from the prior day, courses through the stomach, its tip not visualized. the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. there is persistent patchy left lower lobe and lingular consolidation that is somewhat less extensive in appearance. there is no pneumothorax or definite effusion. the patient has been extubated. . brief hospital course: 1. respiratory failure: the patient was transferred to the icu on ___ for hypoxia and presumed aspiration. she was intubated upon arrival to the icu. a chest xray showed a new lll infiltrate, which likely represented pneumonitis in response to her aspiration. at the same time, she is at risk for gram-negative infections given her recent hospitalizations. she was started on vancomycin and zosyn given this risk for pneumonia. she was given 5 liters of normal saline for hypotension and briefly required levophed, likely in the setting of propofol sedation. on ___, she underwent ___ placement of a post-pyloric dobhoff for tube feeds and an ng tube for suction/decompression. a repeat kub was obtained, which was unchanged from ___, thereby decreasing suspicion for small bowel obstruction. she also underwent bronchoscopy, which showed largely normal anatomy, and bal which was sent for gram stain/culture. sputum gram stain showed 25+ polys and 2+ yeast. following bromchoscopy, sedation was weaned, and the patient had an excellent spontaneous breathing trial. she was extubated, and was maintaining good oxygen saturation on nasal cannula and was normotensive. . 2. fever. the patient was febrile prior to aspiration/transfer. differential includes pneumonia, infectious diarrhea, uti, line infection. infectious workup, including c. diff, was negative for diarrhea, and patient had no stools when tfs were stopped. per gi, the patient has a combination of gastric dysmotility and intestinal hypermobility, which is likely the cause of her diarrhea. also has had cvl for 6 days so line infection is a consideration. plan to d/c cvl when extubated and hemodynamically stable. blood and urine cultures were also sent, and showed no growth. the patient was also given stress dose steroids. 3. diarrhea. per notes, somewhat improved over last couple days. initially coffee-ground and guaiac positive; now brown, guaiac negative. tube feeds held. lactulose and rifaximin continued. infectious stool studies negative. . 4. gi dysmotility. history of sbos and psbos s/p multiple ex-laps in past. initially felt to have partial sbo on kub but was having diarrhea and flatus. mr enterography ___ showed right colonic edema consistent with portal hypertension. the erythromycin and metoclopramide were stopped. ng and post-pyloric dobhoff were placed as above. there was not resolution on ___ the patient was taken to the or by dr ___ for lysis of adhesions as sbo was not resolving with return of gi function. several enterotomies were made and an ostomy was created in the r lower quadrant. this is a very large ostomy and requires special appliances. following the surgery, the ostomy started having outout within a few days. on occasion, the ostomy output was greater than 1 liter of stool, octreotide was tried with good result, and towards the end of the hospitalization, the stool has decreased significantly and the octreotide has been stopped. . 5. cirrhosis: secondary to sarcoidosis. complicated by varices, history of encephalopathy. lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, nadolol were continued, but multiple adjustments were made over the course of the hospitalization, please see the final med list for current medications. . 6. sarcoidosis: chronic issue. related to her cirrhosis. - continue steroids 7. seizures: continue phenytoin and keppra. these was some reoccurence of seizure activity while the patient was in the icu following the surgery. dosing was adjusted, continue to follow dilantin levels weekly. . 8 nutrition: initially had dobhoff placed, but secondary to bowel issues, this was stopped. patient has been followed by nutrition services with daily tpn. caloric intake toward the end of the hospitalization is not adequete, and tpn via picc line will be continued. . long and complicated hospital course with many adjustements to medications and therapies. currently the only line is a picc line. the patient is devoid of all drains. she has an ostomy that is well functioning. she will

hepatic sarcoid, multiple sbos and recent ex-lap. her hospital course was protracted, below is a summary by chronological problem. # sepsis: likely sources are staph epidermidis from ___ line and vre in urine. patient initially needed low dose levophed to keep map>60 after ivf boluses, but this vasopressor was quickly weaned off. stress dose steroids were also started as the patient is chronically on prednisone 10 mg daily. these were then tapered and planned return to home dose on ___. per id, she was started on meropenem and linezolid and continued on these while in the icu. patient had vre growing at osh, as well as staph epi in the blood, but no vre or staph epi were isolated inhouse. murmur heard on exam; thus, echo completed and without vegetations. also, given multiple sbos and enterocutatneous fistula, surgery was consulted and recommended non-urgent ct scan to evaluate. ct abd/pelvis was performed to rule out perinephric abscess, which was negative for abscess or any other intrabdominal pathology. initial urinary cultures grew only yeast, so patient was treated with 3 days of fluconazole. meropenem and linezolid were changed to vancomycin only to complete a total of 8 day course of antibiotics for line sepsis. this resolved during the hospitalization # acute renal failure: per rehab notes, her cr has been increasing and lasix (home medication) had been held. cr was 1.5 on ___. renal ultrasound negative. likely elevated in setting in sepsis and hypotension. cr trended and renally dosed medications. the patient was discharged with a cr of 1.2 that was stable at

she return to the floor with an uncompromised respiratory status. on the floor, she continued to have intermittent episodes of emesis. during one episode 5 days prior to d/c, an ngt was placed. ultimately, it fell out and the pt reufsed all further ngt placement. she was started on cisapride and these gradually faded with resolution by the time of d/c # ostomy output: had large quantity of secretory ostomy output. improvement after octreotide and tincture of opium added. nevertheless, this was a serious problem this hospitalization. it was managed with octreotide until the pt refused that medication ___ the pain of injection and cholestyramine. we replaced lost fluids with ns and tpn. # urinary tract infection: had klebsiella in urine and received meropenem and then bactrim for a total 6 day course of antibiotic treatment. # history of seizures: continued keppra and dilantin. secondary to gastroparesis and malabsorption, she requires the phenytoin suspension formula. ___ to

hepatic encephalopathy given her recent admissions for the same in which lactulose non-adherence has been suspected; this is her ___ admission with delirium secondary to hepatic encephalopathy within the last month. ms. ___ was intubated for airway protection in the ed; she was extubated without difficulty in the micu and remained stable on room air. she admits to taking less lactulose than prescribed due to diarrhea and frequent bowel movements ___ per day) several days prior to admission. hard stool was noted on rectal exam in ed, which reinforced the theory that she was non-adherent with the lactulose as prescribed. her home regimen of lactulose 30 ml po tid was restarted (with ___ bms per day) and her mental status quickly cleared. . other differential diagnosis for her delirium was considered, including infection, hypothyroidism, intoxication, and medication overdose. however, these alternate diagnoses were felt to be less likely. specifically, sbp was considered. paracentesis was not performed in the ed, and she was empirically covered with ceftriaxone for 3 days. ceftriaxone was discontinued on the day prior to discharge considering her marked clinical improvement with lactulose and the low probability of sbp. meningitis was unlikely clinically--nonelevated wbc and no systemic symptoms; she also underwent lp during late ___ for a similar presentation of delirium and the lp was negative. cxr was negative; urinalysis was negative; and wbc count was nonelevated to suggest other infection. gastrointestinal infectious workup was negative for ova and parasites in the stool, e. coli 0157:h7, and clostridium difficile x1. infectious diarrhea was unlikely as the patient was having a normal bowel movements for her level of lactulose ___ per day) upon discharge and showed no other signs of infection. . also, her altered mental status was too acute to be a typical presentation of hypothyroidism affecting the sensorium; tsh was within normal limits at the end of ___. urine/serum tox screen was negative in the ed. sedating meds including amitriptyline and gabapentin were held on presentation but were restarted once her mental status returned to baseline. . #. hepatic sarcoid/cirrhosis transaminases were stable as compared to baseline. the total bilirubin level was more elevated than previously (at 1.6 on admission) but trended downward to within-normal-limits range, 1.3 on dicharge. alkaline phosphatase was stably elevated at ~175. the patient appears chronically thrombocytopenic in low 100s but upon discharge her platelet count was 80. coagulation panel is essentially normal except for an elevated ptt, which may be more elevated than normal but could be secondary to heparin flushes/subcutaneous heparin. albumin 3.0 suggests relatively preserved synthetic hepatic function. home medications, nadolol, rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol were continued. also her patient's outpatient dose of prednisone (10 mg daily) was continued for sarcoid. . #. anemia/thrombocytopenia: her baseline hct appears to be in the high ___, low ___ she was approximately baseline on admission with a hct of 31. she has a normal mcv and relatively normal fe/folate/b12 studies; her anemia is likely anemia of chronic disease. her hematocrit trended downward to <23.5. prior to discharge, she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after consulting the liver service. she showed no evidence of hemolysis on labs (normal total bilirubin, normal haptoglobin), no evidence of gastorintestinal bleeding though she has known esophageal varices and a known colonic ateriovenous malformation. . #. cardiomyopathy her most recent ef was 40-45% (echo in ___, which was improved from 15% previously. the etiology of her cardiomyopathy was not entirely clear and has been classified as idiopathic in the past. the patient is only on a beta-blocker; she is on neither an acei nor diuretics. continued nadolol as per outpatient regimen. . #. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease she showed no signs of bronchospam throughout her hospitalization. an albuterl prn inhaler was provided. #. hypothyroidism: ___ was last

likely caused the fever. we are treating you with a medicine to kill the yeast. it will be very important for you to take good care of your new picc line. this means wearing gloves, sterilizing the line before using, keeping your ostomy supplies separate from your picc line supplies, and following the instructions of the nurses who help with your tpn. this will help prevent future infections which could make you very, very sick. you also had some findings on the ultrasound of your heart and your ekg that require that you follow-up with a cardiology doctor as an outpatient. you should speak with your primary care doctor regarding this, as you may need a \"stress test\" to evaluate your heart. please note the following medication changes: -please take ranitidine, 300mg, at night (this is a change from taking 150mg in the morning and 150mg in the evening) -please start micafungin iv daily until ___. the infectious disease doctors ___ be following the data from your blood culture to make sure that this medication effectively treats your infection. if it does not, you may hear from them about starting a different medication -please start lidocaine patch for your back pain -please start aspirin once daily (81mg) for your heart -please start oxycodone for back pain. this medication can be dangerous with your fentanyl patch, and you should be very careful to not drink alcohol or drive when using this medication. if you are feeling more sleepy or confused than usual, you should also not use this medication. followup instructions: ___ "

for exam: assess line. right picc tip is in the upper right atrium. there is mild cardiomegaly. there is bibasilar atelectasis. there is no pleural effusion. pathology: diagnosis: gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies, four (a-d): 1. gastric antrum (a): chronic inactive gastritis. immunohistochemical stain for helicobacter is negative with adequate controls. 2. duodenum (b): mildly active duodenitis. 3. small bowel ulcer (c): small intestinal mucosa, within normal limits. 4. small bowel (d): duodenal mucosa within normal limits. note: no granulomata or dysplasia identified. ___: small bowel enteroscopy scattered ulcers in the ileum compatible with crohns (biopsy), mild friability and erythema in the ileum compatible with ileitis (biopsy), otherwise normal ileoscopy to ___: egd erythema and erosion in the antrum and pylorus compatible with gastritis vs crohns (biopsy) nodularity, granularity, friability and erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis (biopsy). otherwise normal egd to third part of the duodenum brief hospital course: ___ yo male with crohn's disease c/b multiple prior sbos s/p resections, ?short-gut syndrome on tpn, right picc and prior stomal bleeds who presents with 1l of bright red bloody output from ileostomy bag x 1 day, associated with heartburn, abdominal pain, and poor po intake. # gib: bright red blood could indicate upper or lower gib. given patient complaints of both heartburn and abdominal pain, he could have new or erosive ulcers from esophagus to ileum explaining his symptoms and as potential sources of bleeding. less likely etiologies include variceal bleed given no evidence of portal htn on exam with normal lfts and platelet count, although pt is at increased risk of developing tpn induced liver injury especially if crohn's disease is not better medically optimized. lgib etiologies include sb ulcer below the ligament of treitz, nsaid induced-duodenal ulcers although pt was only on asa 81 and stopped taking it in ___. his inflammatory markers were quite high indicating that he definitely has marked ongoing inflammation. pt had egd/ileoscopy which showed gastritis vs. crohn's ulcer in gastric antrum and friable ulcer in ileum c/w ileitus and biopsies were obtained. final path showed gastritis and duodenitis. h-pylori not seen on final path as well. patient was treated with methylprednisone iv and marked reduction in his pain and inflammatory markers. he was transitioned to prednisone 60mg po daily and will continue on this until follow-up with his outpatient gastroenterologist dr. ___. his diet was slowly advanced and he was tolerating po prior to discharge. # crohn's disease: symptoms returned after patient started smoking about ___ years ago. he does have chronic ileitis on biopsy and some ulcers on endoscopy, although admittedly clean based. would likely benefit from systemic therapy as a trial to see if symptoms improve and to prevent further complications. patient was seen by social work for tobacco cessation counseling. home budesonide, cholestyramine, and ursodiol were continued. hepatitis serologies, quantiferon gold, ebv and cmv were checked prior initiation of anti-tnf therapy which is planned in the near future. # anemia: ___ iron deficiency as well as anemia of chronic disease. repeat labs confirmed iron deficiency. he was restarted on iron supplimentation # high stool output with presumed short gut syndrome: pt reports having tried everything in the past w/o relief, but has not tried tincture of opium, willing to try anything. tsh wnl. stool output decreased over his hospital stay with better control of his inflammation. he was continued on mv. for nutrition his picc line was removed and central venous line was placed as it had been scheduled as an outpatient. # ___ on ckd: most likely prerenal secondary to poor po intake. he was treated with ivf and creatinine returned to baseline (~1.3). # hypoxia: unclear etiology. potentially secondary to decreased respirations/sedation from narcotics received in the ed. ibd patients have a higher risk of clot so pe must always be entertained, pt tachycardic (on beta-blockade), no reports of pleuritic cp but is c/o heartburn/reflux. cxr unremarkable, ___ was 100 2l this morning. he was monitored and o2 sats remained consistently stable and >96-97% on ra during his hospital stay. chronic issues: # t2-hypointense and hyperenhancing lesion in the left prostatic apex: seen on mre. urology was consulted and will see mr. ___ as an outpatient for further evaluation. psa was normal. # diabetes: history of chronic prednisone use in the past. glucose was elevated in setting of steroids, he was covered with sliding scale and additional insulin was added to this tpn. # vitamin d deficiency: ___ vitamin d 25-oh 18 at osh while he was on ___ iu daily . he was continued vit d 50k qweek # htn: currently normotensive - home carvedilol initially held for permissive tachycardia in setting of possible acute bleed, but was restarted when hct was stable. # hld: unclear as to why he is on this regimen and not a statin? perhaps pt had elevated lfts in setting of chronic tpn and being on statin. # anxiety/depression: continued duloxetine, held ativan # gerd: h.pylori negative recently at osh and on biopsy at ___. home ppi was held while patient was on ppi gtt. he was discharged home on pantoprazole po bid and ranitidine # fen: ivfs as above / replete lytes prn / clears # ppx: ppi drip, no hep sq given bleeding # access on admission: right double lumen picc # code:

with hemoptysis, fever and chest pain, found to have multiple pulmonary emboli: #. recurrent pulmonary emboli: although ___ has ivc filter, there is clot under the filter seen on imaging above. given prior history of poor adherence, decision was made not to chronically anticoagulate in past. nevertheless, ___ presented with new, significant thrombotic burden. due to diffuse lower and upper extremity pain, ultrasound of all extremities was obtained to evaluate for further deep vein thrombosis, with only evidcence of thrombosis at left posterior tibial vein. ___ was continued on heparin and remained therapeutic. ___ did not exhibit any signs of hemodynamic compromise or right heart strain. we had detailed discussions with ___ about risks of recurrence of hemodynamically significant vte if not anticoagulated. also discussed the importance of close follow up and monitoring if anticoagulated and risk of bleeding if inr is high. he comprehended the information and stated he would be compliant with anticoagulation. given prior history of lack adherence to follow up, hospitalization for severely supra-theraputic levels (16.9), and personality disorder, a multidisciplinary decision was made to attempt to find supervised, structured setting in order assure adherence of plan for anticoagulation. ___ is being continued on lovenox as bridge until coumadin becomes therapeutic, and lovenox should be continued for 2 days while inr therapeutic and then stopped. his inr on day of discharge was 1.9 while on 3 days of 5mg of coumadin. his dose was increased in discharge planning to 6mg daily. reliability of adherence should be re-examined prior to discharging ___ from facility, to decide if coumadin should be continued. this should be done in discussion with the ___ pcp, as well as the setting of is ultimate discharge. . #. hemoptysis: given multiple pulmonary emboli, this most likely represented sub-segmental level emboli causing lung infarction. although ___ has not been

with a past medical history of htn and polysubstance abuse who presented to the ed with chest and abdominal pain and was found to have an anterior stemi. he is now status post bms to the mid-lad. post cardiac catheterization he presented to the ccu with acute onset pulmonary edema and respiratory failure and was intubated on assist control ventilation. he was diuresed with iv lasix initially and he was successfully extubated without complications on hospital day 2. post-extubation, there were no further respiratory issues and lasix was eventually discontinued. serial cxrs showed resolution of the pulmonary edema and the patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently >97% on room air. as the patient was being screened for possible placement in a rehabilitation facility or a shelter it was decided to check his ppd. ppd testing done with a negative ppd confirmed on ___. coronary artery disease: in terms of ___ coronary artery disease, he underwent catheterization at admission with bms placed to lad. his ck peaked at 76 and his tropt peaked at 0.66. he was continued on plavix 75mg po daily, 325mg daily aspirin and started on high dose 80mg of atorvastatin daily. he was kept on integrillin drip for 18 hours. after the catheterization, there were no further episodes of chest pain with the exception of some mild ___ intermittent chest pain on ___ which was reproducible on exam and felt to be musculoskeletal in origin at the left sterno-costal junction. ekg showed t-wave inversions in v2-v5 which had been present in multiple prior ekgs, otherwise nsr, rate mid-70s and oxygen saturation 98% ra. warm compresses helped to alleviate this costo-sternal discomfort. mr. ___ was advised that he would need to continue clopidogrel for at least one month and aspirin for life. he is aware of the risks of repeat cardiac events and/or stroke if he fails to adhere to this regimen and he was advised to be compliant with his medications after discharge. pump function:regarding pump function, the patient presented to the ccu with acute pulmonary edema on imaging in the setting of a recent mi. he was intubated in the cardiac cath lab. recent ttes had shown no baseline systolic heart failure, although likely there was a component of diastolic dysfunction in the setting of severe htn. a tte after the cath showed lvef of 30% and apical hypokinesis with lv mural thrombus. thus, he likely developed this systolic heart failure after suffering his recent mi. he was started on acei and bb to limit further remodeling and control his hr. to manage his mural thrombus, he was started on a heparin drip and then bridged to coumadin 2.5 mg qhs and his inr was 2.7 on ___. he has failed anticoagulation in the past due to medication non-compliance. mr. ___ has a history of pulmonary embolisms and dvts per records and he had an ivc filter placed in ___. the patient was warned of the increased risk of embolic stroke and blood clots in the acute setting of apical thrombus and hypokinesis as well as large dvts. he was initially started on heparin drip and later bridged to warfarin 2.5mg qhs which he continued for the rest of his hospitalization. he had his daily ___ checked. . rhythm: the patient had occasional sinus tachycardia bouts with exertion but he was in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry for the majority of his hospital stay. .. respiratory failure: as above, he presented to the ccu intubated presumably due to acute pulmonary edema in the setting of poor cardiac output and recent acs/ stemi. he was extubated without complications and was gradually weaned back to room air and had oxygen saturations of 97-99% on room air at time of discharge. abdominal pain / constipation: mr. ___ had some mild lower quadrant abdominal distention and pain with deep palpation. he had severe constipation which was probably exacerbated by his methadone regimen and multiple psychiatric medications. he was started on a bowel regimen with dulcolax, senna, colace and then lactulose was added and patient began to have regular daily bowel movements and his mild abdominal distension and nausea improved thereafter for the remainder of his hospital stay. coffee-ground emesis: at time of presentation, it appeared he was having abdominal discomfort because he grimaced on deep palpation of his abdomen. pancreatic and liver enzymes were sent and all returned normal. the abdominal pain later resolved post-extubation with the exception of some mild lower quadrant distension and tenderness in the setting of severe constipation. ct ___ was negative for pulmonary or intra-aortic process. abdominal imaging was unremarkable. he was also noted to have coffee ground aspirate from his og tube, which cleared after gastric lavage. however, on hospital day 1 his hematocrit dropped rather precipitously from 29 to 24. a central line was placed and 2u prbcs transfused to which he responded appropriately with a hematocrit bump to 30. gi was consulted and did not believe there was any urgent indication for scope, as his bleeding had resolved. . he was started on bid ppi and tapered to daily 40mg po dose. his hematocrit increased to baseline mid ___ and remained stable for the rest of the hospitalization. gi service would like to perform upper endoscopy, but as he is no longer actively bleeding there is no indication for an urgent inpatient procedure and gi felt that patient could follow up at a later date as an outpatient for an elective egd. # hypertension: he has a history of malignant hypertension managed with clonidine, amlodipine, and unclear whether he takes hctz as his discharge summaries reflect different regimens. we attempted to work with an acei and bb given comorbidity of cad keeping in mind that he has very difficult to control htn at baseline and may require additional medications. ultimately, blood pressure was well controlled with a triple regimen of 5mg daily lisinopril, clonidine patch and 25mg po bid metoprolol. .. # copd: we continued the patient' home ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed while he was hospitalized. .. # right ___ dvt: identified on ___ after patient complained of right groin pain and right leg became swollen. vascular surgery consult done and thrombectomy or other procedure was deemed not needed as circulation appears intact, there is no evidence for compartment syndrome and swelling is slowly resolved. pt has an ivc filter that was placed after an episode of pe in the past. coumadin has been continued and pt will need to continue this indefinitely. pt will also need a hematology consult in the future to assess for clotting derangements once dvt is resolved. pt will need a repeat ___ ultrasound in ___ months to assess for interval change. the patient's compliance with his inr checks at ___ and the importance of taking his daily warfarin to prevent strokes and additional clots or complications was stressed and reinforced on multiple occasions. # methadone maintenance: we continued his home methadone dose of 135 mg daily. .. # depression / anxiety: stable; we continued his home duloxetine, clonazepam, and quetiapine initially and psychiatry was consulted for additional input during the ___ hospital stay and the patient's seroquel was increased to 200mg qhs dosing alongside 50mg bid prn seroquel regimen as well. the patient continued to have some hypotension and seroquel was discontinued. he had his duloxetine gradually uptitrated and his symptoms were well controlled at time of discharge. # social : social work consult was arranged to explore the best approach for the patient to be able to more easily afford his medications. a search was initiated to help place mr. ___ in a short term housing/rehabilitation/partial shelter setting given his multiple medical comorbidities and his social situation which is complicated by his polysubstance abuse history and intermittent homelessness. physical therapy also evaluated mr. ___ and ___ that he was stable for discharge and felt he was physically capable to resume his pre-hospitalization activity. #prophylaxis: dvt prophylaxis was with heparin sq, then switched to heparin drip after the finding of apical thrombus on tte and patient ultimately bridged to coumadin. gi prophylaxis with ppi bid initially given concern over potential gi bleed. ppi later switched to 40mg daily protonix. he was kept on a cardiac, heart-healthy diet. his code status remained full code throughout his hospital stay. medications on admission: methadone 135mg daily acetaminophen prn duloxetine 20

block although is nondiagnostic prolonged q-tc interval - is nonspecific anterior myocardial infarction with st-t wave configuration consistent with acute/recent/in evolution process since previous tracing of ___, no significant change cxr ___: impression: cardiomegaly, with mild right heart failure. trans thoracic echo ___: the left atrium is mildly dilated. no atrial septal defect is seen by 2d or color doppler. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (lvef= 35-40 %) with global hypokinesis and akineis aof the distal lv/apex. basal segments move best. there is no ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal free wall function. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. trace aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, an apical thrombus is no longer seen and the lv systolic function is slightly better. cardiac perfusion persantine ___: impression: 1. moderate fixed apical defect and moderate fixed distal anterior and distal inferior wall defects which are likely secondary to the reported mi. 2. increase in the left ventricular size and decrease in lvef. cta chest w/ and w/o contrast ___: impression: 1. negative examination for pulmonary embolism. 2. mediastinal and axillary enlarged lymph nodes with splenomegaly. 3. improvement of previously described hazy infiltration in the right middle lobe. brief hospital course: this is a homeless ___ year old male with a past medical history of of recent stemi s/p bms to lad, hypertension, post-tramatic stress disorder, and depression who presents with hypotension and chest pain. 1) hypotension: hypotension is likely secondary to patient's recent myocardial infarction. patient was ruled out for possibility of a new myocardial infarction by three negative sets of cardiac enzymes, no st-t wave changes on ecg. he also underwent a nuclear perfusion stress test that did not show any new defects. an echocardiogram actually showed improved lv systolic function compared to ___. patient also had a cta that did not indicate new pulmonary embolism. adrenal insufficiency was considered though a cosyntropin stimulation test ruled this out. patient does have an elevated tsh of 4.4, though this is difficult to interpret in the setting of recent hospitalization. patient's blood pressure medications were held for the first few hospital days and blood pressure remained stable, with systolics slowly increasing to the 110's-120's. lisinopril was restarted and has been titrated up to 5 mg daily. patient was also restarted on metoprolol 25 mg daily. 2) chest pain: as noted above, patient was ruled out for mi by cardiac enzymes and an nuclear perfusion test that did not show any new defects. patient continues to describe brief intermittent left sided chest pressure. the etiology of this pain is very unclear. there was no evidence on ecg or echocardiogram of pericardial effusion. pain is not reproducible with palpation making a musculoskeletal or costochondritis etiology less likely. patient is to continue taking daily lisinopril, metoprolol and aspirin for cardioprotecion. 3) pancytopenia: patient noted to have pancytopenia on admission. wbc ct and platelets did return to normal range over course of hospitalization. patient does remain anemic. iron studies indicated anemia of chronic disease. patient's reticulocyte count is 1.4, which is the low end of normal. notably, patient was found to have enlarged spleen on chest ct. patient has an appointment to follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient to further work-up possible causes of decreased bone marrow activity and splenomegaly. 4)recurrent pulmonary emboli, s/p ivc: as noted above, new pulmonary embolus was considered as possible cause of both hypotension and chest pain. pt had cta that did not indicate evidence of new pe. patient was maintained on warfarin for anticoagulation. we did not discharge the patient with a prescription for coumadin because neither the ___ clinic here at ___ nor the patient's primary care provider at ___ ___ associates are able to prescribe coumadin or monitor inr for someone who is homeless given the technical difficulties of communicating results and dose adjustments. the only option for homeless patients on coumadin is to be followed at the ___ ___ anticoagulation clinic, which requires that patients have a pcp at ___. for the reason, the patient agreed to have us connect him with a new primary care provider at ___ so that he can utilize the ___ clinic services there. patient was also given the option of being placed in a nursing home so as to have an environment where his medical needs could be more closely attended to, however, the patient declined this option. 5) chronic obstructive airway disease: patient was continued on his nebulizer and inhaler treatments. 6) somnolence: at time of admission patient seemed rather somnolent and there was concern that his clonazepam, seroquel cymbalta or methadone may have been contributing factors. patient's clonazepam dose was reduced to 1 mg tid. nursing staff was also instructed to make sure that the patient swallowed all medications, given his history of hoarding medications. he was seen by psychiatry who felt that clonazepam could slowly be increased back to 2 mg tid if patient did not continue to demonstrate somnolence. we were able to titrate dose back up to 2 mg tid and patient did not demonstrate further evidence of daytime somnolence. 7) depression: at beginning of hospital stay patient reported that he felt extremely depressed. as noted above, patient was seen by psychiatry who recommended increasing his daily cymbalta dose from 40 mg to 60 mg. psychiatry also recommended that patient have outpatient psychiatry follow up. patient should have this follow up arranged by his new primary care physician at ___. 8) post-traumatic stress disorder: patient was continued on seroquel. as noted above, clonazepam was reduced when team concerned about daytime somnolence. this medication was titrated back up to 2 mg tid when it was clear that patient was not demonstrating somnolence. 9)gastroesophageal reflux disease: patient was continued on prilosec 20 mg bid. 10) homelessness: as noted above, the medical team, social work and case management attempted to address patients post hospital stay disposition. the ___ house where patient was transferred from would not take the patient back for alleged behavioral issues. the patient was not interested in going to a nursing home facility. social work provided the patient with information related to shelters in the ___ area. medications on admission: medications on transfer: -mvi daily -colace 100mg tid -asa ec 81mg daily -flomax 0.4mg qhs -simvastatin 80mg daily -cymbalta xr 40mg daily -senna prn

bilateral lower extremity edema. initially transferred to micu from the floor for management of hypotension and hypoxia of unknown source; observed and transferred back to floor for further management. hospital course was as follows. on morning of admission, patient received his usual clonazepam 2 mg and methadone 135 mg am. shortly thereafter he was found to be slightly cyanotic with o2 saturation near 80% and blood pressure to 82/palpable. abg showed 7.33/59/50. patient was placed on nrb with subsequent abg 7.33/56/76, lactate 0.7. patient was started on heparin gtt given concern for pulmonary embolism. he was guiac negative with no hidden medications found (history of hiding medications). patient was transfered to the icu for hypotension and hypoxia. micu course: patient has a history of hypoxia and hypotension secondary to stacking his clonidine, clonazepam and methadone medications. he had an acute episode of hypoxia to high ___ and hypotension and was transferred to the micu. his blood pressure stabilized with sbp in 110's and his spo2 rose to mid ___ on nc shortly after arrival in the icu. likely that his hypoxia/hypotension were related to his medications. he was ruled out for mi w/ serial enzymes and repeated ecgs and transferred back to the floor. levofloxacin was also started given concern for pneumonia. pe was very low on differential as he did not have any chest pain or tachycardia. lenis were negative and his hypoxia/hypotension resolved quickly after arrival in the unit. medicine course: on return to medicine floor, patient reported persistent lower extremity swelling. he was found to have clots in left ventricle and distal to ivc filter, extending into both lower extremities. remainder of hospital course was as follows. 1. ivc, left ventricle thromboses: negative lenis on admission. patient was bridged with heparin drip (goal ptt 60-100) to therapeutic inr with coumadin (goal inr ___. lower extremity swelling resolved with this and diuresis as below. patient has previously been on anticoagulation with coumadin given frequent clotting, but has not taken it correctly as an outpatient and thus not been able to continue. previously scheduled to see hematology as an outpatient for further work-up of suspected thrombophilia but failed to follow-up. should continue on coumadin as outpatient with close follow-up for inr checks. 2. evaluation for competency: sparked by frequent admissions thought to be secondary to medication noncompliance. patient has many serious medical problems but most pressing issue during this hospital course was evaluation of patient's understanding of his medical situation and the necessary measures to care for himself. per report, patient is frequent inpatient and is chronically noncompliant with many medical treatments - e.g. coumadin for hypercoaguability. several parties, including primary ___ medical team, primary care provider, psychiatry, social work, and case management worked together and with patient to optimize care at this hospitalization and potential hospitalizations in the future. through such meetings we found that the patient appears to understand his illness, is not connected with ___, and follows up regularly with his ___ clinic. social work identified ___, a shelter in ___ which distributes medications to residents and has a nurse on site that can check inr, as a good destination for discharge. patient agreed with this plan. patient to also continue visits in hca with dr. ___. 3. hemoptysis: patient reported 6 months of hemoptysis. reported recent ppd was negative. ppd was placed ___ was negative. cta was concerning for parenchymal process in the lungs. ct sinus was negative for sinusitis. per pulmonary consult team, etiology likely related to airway inflammation. sputum cultures were attempted several times but always found to be contaminated specimens. afb negative by sputum acid fast smear. 4. acute on chronic systolic heart failure: lvef has varied between ___ over last few months as patient recovered from stemi (2 months prior to admission). bnp elevated on admission from baseline. on admission, physical exam and cxr suggested fluid overload. improved with diuresis. continued aspirin 325 mg po daily and placed on low-salt, heart healthy diet. ace-inhibitor was held given hypotension prior to micu stay and systolic blood pressure consistently between 90 and 110 thereafter. 5. liver disease: patient with history of hbv and hcv. asterixis on admission which resolved with lactulose. no ascites was seen on mri. 6. recent ugib + gerd/gastritis: had ugib while on asa, plavix, and coumadin, with evidence of gastritis and duodenitis on egd in past. no evidence of bleeding currently. has ongoing hemorrhoids. 7. copd: attempted several times to obtain pfts but patient refused. given frequent episodes of hypoxia, pulmonary consult team suggested aggressive inhaler regimen, including advair, spiriva, albuterol as needed, and ipratropium as needed. 8. anxiety: on admission attempted to wean clonazepam dose given concern for hypoxia secondary to hypoventilation. given increased anxiety and agitation home dose was resumed (2mg po tid). patient was explained risks of high clonazepam dose and told not to drive or operative heavy machinery while at this dose. 9. substance abuse history: continued

acute psychiatric issues, and was deemed to have capacity. there were no further mental status changes during the remainder of his hospitalization. 2. pulmonary edema: the patient developed acute shortness of breath, tachypnea, and wheezing upon arrival to the icu. plain chest film at this time showed evidence of pulmonary edema and fluid overload. it was likely that the patient developed pulmonary edema, possibly in the setting of hypertension following narcan administration. the patient responded well to lasix iv. patient also experienced brief increased oxygen requirement on the floor, which again improved with lasix and bronchodilator/anti-cholinergic therapy. the patient was discharged on room air with clear lung sounds and no subjective shortness of breath. 3. history of pulmonary embolus status post inferior vena cava filter. he was initially placed on heparin gtt in the icu; however, after a conversation with the patient's pcp, the heparin gtt was stopped and the patient's anticoagulation was held. the patient is a poor candidate for coumadin, given his persistent noncompliance. anti-coagulation was held during his hospitalization secondary to medical non-compliance, and the patient was discharged without anti-coagulation. 4. polysubstance abuse in remission. patient has history of substance abuse. he is on methadone maintance at baseline. the ___ clinic was called today, and the patient's current dose is 125 mg daily. he was thus restarted on his methadone after his mental status improved, and was continued on this dose for the duration of his hospital course. 5. uti - the patient began complaining of dysuria and found to have a urine culture postive for pansensitive e. coli. he was started on ciprofloxacin and told to complete a ___. cad - he had been discharged previously on metoprolol, but this was not restarted while in the hospital secondary to systolics in the 100s. he is scheduled for follow up and should restart his metoprolol at that time. he was continued on his outpatient dose of aspirin, simvastatin and lisinopril. 7. copd - he was maintained on his nebulizers (albuterol, atrovent). 8. gerd - stable. continuted pantoprazole. all other medical issues remained stable. no other medication changes were made. medications on admission: med list per omr: albuterol clonazepam 2mg po tid duloxetine [cymbalta] 30mg po

to assess for an intracardiac shunt due to suboptimal image quality. left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. there is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/aneurysm of he apex and mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (lvef = 50 %). the right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. the aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. there is no aortic valve stenosis. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. the pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. there is no pericardial effusion. impression: suboptimal image quality. normal left ventricular cavity size with apical aneurysm/akinesis. no definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. ___ cta chest: 1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 2. consolidations in the lungs bilaterally, are likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia, with reactive lymphadenopathy. 3. extensive abdominal wall varices, gynecomastia, and splenomegaly, suggestive of chronic liver disease. cirrhosis can't be excluded. 4. new 3 mm nodule within the left upper lobe. if the patient is at high risk for malignancy, or has a history of smoking, a 12 month followup with chest ct is recommended for further evaluation. ___ cxr: comparison to ___. no relevant change. bilateral areas of atelectasis. low lung volumes. mild cardiomegaly. no pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. no pleural effusion. ___ arterial flows: on the right side, triphasic doppler waveforms are seen in the right femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. the right abi was 1.29. on the left side, triphasic doppler waveforms are seen at the left femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. the left abi was 1.28. pulse volume recordings showed symmetric amplitudes bilaterally, at all levels. impression: no evidence of arterial insufficiency to the lower extremities bilaterally at rest. ___ ct abdomen and pelvis: 1. chronic occlusion of the infrarenal ivc with extensive collateral formation unchanged from prior examination. 2. mild thickening of the urinary bladder may be related to cystitis. 3. persistent splenomegaly. 4. unchanged l1 compression fracture. ___ bilateral ___ ultrasound: there is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the bilateral common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. normal color flow is demonstrated in the posterior tibial veins of the upper calf bilaterally. the peroneal veins were not visualized. asymmetry of waveforms in the right and left common femoral veins likely reflect collateral pathways in the setting of chronic ivc thrombus. tortuous collaterals are seen superior to the left common femoral vein. no evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. impression: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the imaged right or left lower extremity veins. nonvisualization of the peroneal veins of the bilateral upper calf. ___ cxr: battery pack overlies the left mid chest. mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears slightly worse compared to the prior study. no focal consolidation is seen. there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. impression: mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly worse compared to the prior study. brief hospital course: ___ w/ h/o cad s/p stemi w/ bms in lad in ___, ckd, copd, htn, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder p/w unclear duration of increasing ___ edema, inability to ambulate and worsening dyspnea. #dyspnea: patient reported worsening shortness of breath during hospital stay, initially presumed from volume overload as below and diuresed with iv lasix. patient had reported increasing sputum production with wheezes on exam thus he was treated for copd exacerbation, given levofloxacin and prednisone (40 mg) and completed a 5 day course. he had some symptomatic improvement however continued to have intermittent oxygen use, per him he uses ___ l o2 at night. he underwent a cta on ___ without e/o pe, but revealed bilateral consolidations c/f multifocal pneumonia, with reactive lymphadenopathy, however he was afebrile without any leukocytosis. he underwent a tte, which showed mild left ventricular hypokinesis, no significant valvular pathology, no clear shunting. inpatient pulmonary was consulted who found no evidence of desaturations. while his venous collaterals could lead to pooling in the lower extremities with resultant reduction in venous return to the heart and hypoxemia, this was not demonstrated on walking with mr. ___. his wheezing seemed more related to secretions than copd. he endorsed aspiration symptoms and has risk factor with his poor dentition. patient's orthostatic vital signs were stable, and was discharged with no additional oxygen requirement. speech and swallow evaluated him and this showed that the patient had mild oropharyngeal dysphagia marked by impulsivity in acceptance, reduced mastication, edentulous status, and one episode of wet vocal quality with a very large bolus of thin liquids. their recommendations included pureed to ground solids (per pt's baseline preference) with thin liquids. he was instructed to sit upright for all po intake, take single sips, and continue with food preparation consistent with his edentulous status. medications should be whole in applesauce to avoid consecutive sips of thin liquids. #acute decompensation of diastolic heart failure: no clear history c/w acute chf exacerbation. reports medication compliance. last ef in ___ noted to be 50% and last discharge weight was 103kg on ___. bilateral lower extremity edema, pulmonary vascular congestion, weight gain and admitted medication non-compliance prompt concern for acute chf exacerbation. beyond medication and diet non-compliance, could also be substance use. ischemia less likely given stable ecg and normal troponins. notably, patient admitted in ___ of this year with similar complaints; at that time he had mild congestion on cxr and bnp of 1711 (lower than today's). after diuresis, his leg edema did not resolve. patient was continued on home po lasix and was net negative on urine output. #chronic venous stasis: this was likely related to lymphedema from recurrent dvt with minor component from ___. there was no evidence of overlying cellulitis. in the past, his leg pain has limited his mobility significantly. he was last discharged to ___ for continued physical therapy. his chronic findings are also likely from thrombosed ivc filter. he has primarily been managed as an outpatient by diuresis with lasix and pain medications. he was assessed by vascular surgery who felt that he has bilateral strongly palpable pulses which suggests good perfusion to the leg and foot. his right lower extremity ulcer is likely ___ chronic venous stasis changes as he has severe stasis skin changes. they recommended no further surgical intervention. he was asked to elevate his legs as much as possible, and have ace wraps over legs. imaging showed no further dvt in lower legs and no arterial flow issues. #chest pain: known h/o cad s/p stemi w/ bms to lad. troponins negative x2 in ed today. ekg without ischemic changes. patient had intermittent chest pains during his hospital course, associated with days he was given iv diuretics. this corresponded to runs of nsvt on telemetry monitoring. his electrolytes were stable with no derangements and ekg was unchanged. given no documented history of varices, his nadolol was switched to metoprolol low dose for nsvt. aspirin 81 was added for secondary prevention. he was continued on home atorvastatin 40 mg po qpm. #cad s/p stemi with bms to lad: continued aspirin and atorvastatin as above. #hcv cirrhosis: complicated by hepatic encephalopathy in the past; has no known history of esophageal varices. no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy at this time. some ruq tenderness. lfts were normal. patient's abdominal imaging showed evidence of splenomegaly, abdominal wall varices, and cirrhosis cannot be excluded. given hepatitis c history, patient should get further liver evaluation for workup. #anemia, chronic: ___ be related to cirrhosis. he may need further eval as an outpatient. # polysubstance abuse: patient has long history of chronic narcotics use and heroin abuse. given intermittent chest pain, assessed utox/stox for substances which were negative. requested oxycontin immediately on arrival; patient appeared somnolent however, so this was withheld and only provided intermittently when patient was awake/alert. continued methadone 65mg qd which was verified with his ___. # copd: at home, patient is on ___ nc. most recent copd exacerbation in ___ for which he was given a prednisone burst and 5 day course of augmentin. his lung exam revealed wheezes with preserved o2 sats, good movement of air. he was given a 5 day course of prednisone 40 and levofloxacin for copd exacerbation. # chronic hx pe/dvt: inr was therapeutic, making recurrent dvt unlikely, with no evidence of new clots on lower extremity ultrasound. he was continued on warfarin. # chronic pain: long-acting oxycontin increased to 40mg tid by pcp ___ ___. some somnolence on exam today likely due to co-administration of oxycodone and methadone. continued gabapentin 800mg tid as well. continue bowel regimen while inpatient.methadone dose was verified and provided. # htn: held lisinopril as per pcp recommendations on ___. his bps were stable to low without an anti-hypertensive. # depression/ptsd: continued home clonazepam 2 mg po tid # bph: continued home tamsulosin 0.4 mg po qhs # gerd and history of gi bleeding: continued home omeprazole 20 mg po daily # nutritional

intermittent chest pain. you underwent various tests which showed that you were unlikely suffering from any acute heart problems. your leg swelling unfortunately is chronic, and vascular surgeons did not feel surgery would be helpful. you also reported worsening shortness of breath, that did not help with fluid removal from lungs as well as copd treatment with nebulizers and antibiotics. you got a ct scan of your lungs which did not show any clot. lung specialists who saw you recommended no current further workup, but continued treatment for your copd. please consider working with physical therapy for your leg pain. the changes you see in your legs are mostly chronic in nature and can become worse with inactivity. compression stockings may also offer some relief. you were seen by vascular surgery who did not feel that there was any operative intervention that would help. we had physical therapy evaluate you while you were in the hospital and they recommended that you be discharged to a rehabilitation facility, but you declined. as an alternative to rehab, they recommended that you be discharged home with your rollator ___ services, and 24 hour supervision and home physical therapy. please continue taking all of your medications and following up closely with your primary care doctor. it was a pleasure taking part in your care, your ___ care team followup

persistent hilar engorgement. mild pulmonary interstitial edema likely present. no large effusion or pneumothorax. no convincing signs of pneumonia. mediastinal contour is unchanged. bony structures are intact. ecg (___): old anterior infarct, sinus bradycardia ruq us (___): 1. limited evaluation of the left lobe of the liver however, no focal lesions or parenchymal abnormalities are seen. 2. mild splenomegaly. 3. normal biliary tree. abdominal xray (___): nonspecific bowel gas pattern. cxr (___): pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, but there is now mild interstitial edema. mild cardiac enlargement is stable. there is no pleural effusion. there are no focal pulmonary abnormalities to suggest pneumonia and no appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. ekg (___): sinus bradycardia, old anteroseptal infarct, and no ste/std/twi suggestive of ischemia. ekg (___): nsr, qtc 408 brief hospital course: mr. ___ is a medically complex ___ m h/o cad, chf, dvt on couamdin, multiple recent admissions for dyspnea, difficulty ambulating, who presented again with altered mental status, dyspnea, diffuse abdominal pain, and difficulty ambulating, in the setting of mild decompensated heart failure. acute medical problems: ======================= #acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: on admission, based on b/l pitting edema, worsening dyspnea, and pulmonary edema on cxr, concern for mild decompensated heart failure. ischemic heart disease less likely in setting of negative troponin x1. pt takes meds at home and reports med compliance, but concern for overall poor social situation suggest that med or diet noncompliance are possible. weight on last hospital discharge was 108.9 kg. weight on admission was 111 kg and he was given lasix iv until he reached his baseline weight, when he was restarted on his home lasix 40 mg po. he was net negative on this and he described an episode when he fell (see below), so lasix was held the following 3 days. he was sent home on 20 mg lasix po ___ of his home dose). #copd exacerbation: on admission, patient's lung exam is diffusely wheezy, suggesting mild copd exacerbation as well. patient is satting well on home 2l o2 and does not report any new cough or sputum production. it is possible that in the setting of altered mental status, failure to thrive, he has not been using his inhalers as prescribed. he was given prednisone 40 mg qd for 5 days, standing duonebs, and home tiotropium. initially, antibiotics were held to avoid qtc prolongation. however, since is still complained of sputum production, he was started on levofloxacin on ___ and his qtc was 408 on ___. he completed this course on ___ (6 days). #uri: throughout his admission, he has been complaining of increased mucus production, weakness, sore throat, and headache. this was thought to be due to a common cold that could exacerbate his underlying reactive airway. he was started on fluticasone 2 puff bid and cepacol lozenges. he will go home with fluticasone, nasal spray, and cepacol lozenges. #subacute abdominal pain: the patient has provided a very unclear history about his abdominal pain, but he reports that his abdomen has been distended and tender for one week, and he reports that he has not been eating for one week as well. all initial lft's, lipase, cbc wnl, and his exam is only moderately tender to palpation. his abdominal swelling is likely due to mild chf exacerbation causing abdominal swelling since he had no ascites on ed us. he has caput medusa on exam and a history of ivc filter thrombosis in the past. unclear if this can contribute to pain. ruq us on ___ showed no focal lesions and normal biliary tree and kub showed no obstruction. he is no longer complaining of abdominal pain. #altered mental status: was somnolent on admission, but became alert by the morning. apparently due to psychiatric history he has waxing/waning sensorium and has presented similarly to this prior. unclear the cause but so far metabolic workup negative, infectious workup so far negative, no leukocytosis, no h/o liver disease to suggest he. he is on many sedating medications which are likely to contribute. initially held gabapentin, but was restarted after two days due to complaints of leg pain. he was continued on his pain regimen as stated below. #fall: on ___, had a fall while going to the bathroom. he does not know what time this occurred, but denies loc or hitting his head. denied palpitations or any neurologic deficits. he felt graying out and then landed on his knees. he used the sink to help himself up. he did not notify any nursing staff at this time. no concern for neurological or cardiac abnormalities, but given his diuresis (below his baseline weight by ___ kg) and borderline low bp, hypovolemia is a possibility. orthostatic vs were normal. we held his lasix 2 days after. ___ saw him and recommended home with ___, but he has refused ___ in the past. #chest pain: he had chest pain in the ed with negative troponin and an ekg not concerning for active ischemia. on ___, he also complained of ___ sharp, nonpleuritic, left sternal chest pain that was slightly tender to palpation. cxr showed improved pulmonary vascular congestion, but interstitial edema and no evidence to suggest pna. ekg showed no evidence of active ischemia. low concern for pe (no increased oxygen requirement or pleuritis), acs (ekg at baseline without signs of active ischemia), or intrapulmonary process (no evidence of pna). thus, it is likely musculoskeletal pain or radiation from his abdominal discomfort. this resolved on its own. chronic medical issues: ======================= #frequent hospitalizations and noncompliance: this patient has had multiple recent admissions. while he says he takes his medications, he has multiple complex medical issues and it does not seem like he can ___ for himself adequately. he claims he does not have a ___, but past documentation has suggested that he did, but he refuses working with them when they visit. he also refuses to work with ___ and he has stated that he refuses to see anyone in clinic other than dr. ___ on ___. an appointment was made for him at ___ on ___, but it questionable if he will show up. #anemia: patient has a history of anemia with baseline hemoglobin in mid 7 to 8 range. unclear reason for this in the past. iron studies suggest iron deficiency anemia (low ferritin, high/normal tibc). no evidence of bleeding and guaiac negative stool #chronic venous stasis: likely related to lymphedema from recurrent dvt with minor component from ___. there were no signs of acute infection. he denied any improvement in his leg pain while hospitalized, but his baseline is difficult to assess given his vague descriptions. he continued on his home gabapentin and was given lasix throughout his hospital stay with significant improvement of his lower extremity edema. he never had signs of bleeding or infection of his ulcers. #cad s/p stemi with bms to lad: he was continue on his home aspirin and atorvastatin. #chronic hx pe/dvt: he was continued on his home warfarin and did not require much adjustment throughout his hospital stay. #chronic pain: he was continued on his home methadone 65 mg and 10 mg qd as well as his home oxycodone sr 40 mg q8h. there were several episodes when he accused nursing staff of not giving him his medication, so two nurses had to give it and watch him take it. for constipation, he was continued on his home bowel regimen. #htn: he had borderline blood pressures during his hospital stay, so his home metoprolol was held. #hld: he was continued on his home atorvastatin #depression/ptsd: he was continued on his home clonazepam 2 mg po tid and duloxetine #bph: he was continue on his home tamsulosin 0.4 mg po qhs #gerd and history of gi bleeding: he was continued on his home omeprazole 20 mg po daily #nutritional supplementation: he was continued on his home folate and multivitamin transitional issues: ==================== -his home metoprolol tartrate 12.5 bid was held in the setting of low bp. consider restarting it if his bp starts to rise. -his home lasix 40 mg was cut to 20 mg in the setting of borderline low bp. -compliance on his medications needs to be addressed, especially with his lasix. -he may become a danger to himself due to noncompliance and refusal of services. -he conveyed some abuse-type behavior with his methadone while in the hospital. consider weaning as an outpatient. -his weight on discharge was 106.8 kg (235.45 lb) -he will

overload (up 30 pounds from his dry weight) suggestive of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. he was aggressively diuresed with 120mg iv lasix until he was at his dry weight, but his shortness of breath was still not at baseline. his exam then was significant for diffuse wheezing. he was treated with prednisone and doxycycline for 5 day course for a copd exacerbation, and his wheezing and shortness of breath further improved. he became hyponatremic in the setting of aggressive diuresis. nephrology and cardiology were consulted. diuretics were held for over a week, but he continued to auto-diurese and his sodium continued to drop, but eventually trended upwards. there was concern that his chronically occluded ivc filter was depleting his intravascular volume and perfusion, and vascular surgery was consulted, but recommended no intervention at this time. his new maintenance diuretic regimen was difficult to determine due to auto-diuresis contributing to his hyponatremia. he was discharged on torsemide 20mg. discharge dry weight: 106.1kg # abdominal pain # acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (hfpef): abdominal pain likely secondary to chf exacerbation as he has presented multiple times with similar complaints and seems to improve with diuresis. ct a/p unremarkable. he similarly improved with diuresis. patient presented with weight of 114kg, his weight upon last discharge was 99.1 kg (standing). exacerbation likely secondary to medication non-compliance. he was diuresed aggressively with 120mg iv lasix until he appeared euvolemic. his shortness of breath improved, and he was satting in high 90's on room air. his diuresis was complicated by hyponatremia, in which diuresis was held from ___, but patient continued to auto-diuresis. cardiology and nephrology was consulted. suspected that his previous dose of 80mg torsemide daily resulted in excessive diuresis, and that patient was overloaded secondary to noncompliance, not failure of medical management. his new maintenance dose was difficult ot determine, but after many adjustments, he was stable on torsemide 20mg. he was discharged at a weight of 106.1kg. patient also received a tte, which revealed evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and lvef of 45%. #hyponatremia hyponatremia likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of aggressive diuresis. urine electrolytes consistent with this etiology as well. his diuretics will held as above, but his na continue to fluctuate due to auto-diuresis of unclear etiology. nephrology was consulted to assist with volume status. vascular surgery was also consulted due to concern that patient's chronically occluded ivc filter was contributing to poor intravascular volume and perfusion. however, vascular surgery reported that no surgical intervention was indicated, and that the procedure would be very high risk. patient's hyponatremia improved after holding diuresis and determining an appropriate diuretic regimen as above. # chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: his home medications were continued, he stated that he does not take several of his inhalers at home. his shortness of breath improved with diuresis, however, he still had very significant wheezing concerning for concomitant copd exacerbation. he was treated with 5 days of prednisone and doxycycline (due to prolonged qtc) with improvement of his respiratory status and wheezing. # history of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis on warfarin: home warfarin was continued and adjusted as needed throughout this admission. # pancytopenia: differential diagnosis includes marrow suppression versus mds. ___ monitored throughout admission and appeared chronic and stable. # epidermal inclusion cyst: was likely inflamed versus infected on admission, ruptured spontaneously with no systemic signs of infection. acute care surgery was consulted, did not have any further recommendations. chronic issues: =============== # depression/post-traumatic stress disorder: continued home clonazepam, duloxetine. # coronary artery disease s/p st-elevation myocardial infarction: continued home metoprolol, atorvastatin. # elephantiasis nostras verrucosa / chronic venous stasis: continued wound care and compression as tolerated, wound care consult ordered. vascular surgery was consulted as above, recommending no urgent intervention. # chronic pain: continued home methadone, oxycodone, gabapentin. # benign prostatic hyperplasia: continued home tamsulosin. ***transitional issues*** - repeat basic metabolic panel and evaluate for hyponatremia

dyspnea, increased home supplemental o2 requirement, increased cough productive of brown sputum, feelings of chills, and wheezing on exam suggestive of copd exacerbation. chf exacerbation was also considered as a possible cause of his dyspnea. bnp was elevated at 1153, although it has been as high as 2,900 on prior admissions. additionally, patient's dyspnea did not improve with 40mg iv lasix in ed(although this dose is comparable to his home 20 mg torsemide)and cxr showed only mild pulmonary vascular congestion. the possibility of acute pe was also considered as a possible cause of his dyspnea. the patient has a previous history of pe, but cta did not demonstrate acute pe. the patient is on warfarin and inr was 1.5 on admission. also of note, the patient had a history of chronic anemia(baseline hgb ___ as well as a recent history of admission for leg laceration requiring transfusion of 2 u prbc. he had been slightly below baseline during this admission, which is likely contributing to his dyspnea. he was treated with pred/azithro/duonebs for his copd exacerbation and was eventually able to be weaned to ra. # chest pain: patient continued to endorse non-radiating, constant chest pain in ___ chest that he has had before with copd exacerbation. the pain is worse with deep breaths. cta negative for pe in ed. trop < 0.01, and ekg consistent with prior without any new ischemic changes. thus, his chest pain is likely attributable to his copd exacerbation. # right calf laceration: sutures were placed on ___ following leg injury, with plan to remove sutures within ___ days. sutures were removed ___. no active bleeding or leakage of fluid from the laceration. the region was tender to palpation. per acs recommendation, it was concluded that debridement would not be necessary. patient currently denying evaluation by wound team. at the time of last hospitalization, patient endorsed up to date tetanus shot. medical record indicates last tetanus shot, per patient history, ___. # anemia: patient hasdchronic anemia with baseline hgb ___. ___ labs from ___ were notable for hgb of 6.6, requiring transfusion of 1u prbc. mcv was 82 and rdw was 17.1. follow-up hgb ___ am was 6.5. he required 2u prbcs and had subequent improvement of his h/h. he denied any bleeding from his leg laceration and he denies bleeding from elsewhere, including melena, maroon stools, hematuria. iron studies notable for decreased serum iron of 16, ferritin and tibc were within normal limits (93 and 347 respectively). reticulocyte count was 1.2% with a reticulocyte production index of approximately 0.31. this indicates inadequate rbc production. his h/h upon discharge was 9.4/32.3. #functional status: mr. ___ said that ever since his heart attack, he has been mostly confined to his home. he confirmed that he lives alone in an apartment in ___. he said that he is not able to cook for himself and so he mostly just has food delivered. he said that he has frequent falls at home. he had a history of several hospital admissions for management of his chronic conditions and has previously refused forms of home care including ___. per ___ evaluation ___, patient would benefit from discharge to rehab given his instability with walking. patient initially said that he is \"tired of rehabs and does not want to go\". ___ also recommended use of a walker but patient was resistant to this idea. psychiatry was consulted and suggested the possibility of decreasing his home doses of clonazepam, as benzodiazepines increase risks of falls and confusion in the elderly, as well as methadone. however,patient has been on these medications for decades and does not want to decrease the doses at this time. psychiatry also recommends further neuropsych evaluation through ot assessment of cognitive functioning or through cognitive neurology. he refused these evaluations and though he initially said he was open to the idea of rehab and/or ___, he ultimately refused both of these services prior to his discharge. # constipation: patient reported being constipated during his time in the hospital but noted that this was a chronic issue since he was a teenager. he will commonly go ___ weeks without a normal sized bm. he says that a suppository is the only thing that relieves the constipation. he was was put on an aggressive bowel regimen and had a couple small bowel movements. his constipation was most likely attributable to his long-term use of methadone and oxycodone. # incidental possible arteriovenous fistula: ___ done in ed on the day of admission was notable for right common femoral vein demonstrating high velocity flow which is arterialized proximally and appears to be connected to the common femoral artery concerning for an arteriovenous fistula. lower extremity cta was done ___ to further evaluate for the possibility of av fistula and, as above, did not definitively demonstrate av fistula. chronic issues ================== # chronic heart failure (with mildly depressed ef of 45% on last echo): appeared euvolemic with no sign of exacerbation, below his prior dry weights. # history of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis on coumadin: patient is followed by ___ clinic. he recently had been subtherapeutic so was called to increase his dose to 3.5mg ___ and ___, and continue 2.5mg every other day. continued warfarin per home dosing. # depression/post-traumatic stress disorder: continued home clonazepam, duloxetine. spoke with patient several times about switching to prazosin given the patient's combination of bph and ptsd with nightmares. this option has been discussed with patient and he was initially hesitant but agreed to think about it more. # chronic pain/polysubstance abuse: continued home methadone, oxycodone, gabapentin # benign prostatic hyperplasia: continued home tamsulosin; considered switch to prazosin. transitional issues: discharge weight: 104.3 kg discharge diuretic: torsemide 20 mg po

productive cough. we did some tests and saw that you were not having a heart attack, but it appears that you were having a copd flare. you were treated with breathing treatments, antibiotics, and steroids, and you improved quite a bit. you also were found to have low blood counts. you were given multiple blood transfusions. your blood counts stabilized, and we monitored you for any signs of bleeding. other than some minor oozing from the wounds on your legs, you did not appear to have any significant source of bleeding. we do think it is important that you follow up with someone because you have had low blood counts for quite some time. we spoke with you on multiple occasions about the fact that physical therapy and your medical team think it would be safer for you to be discharged to rehab rather than going home. you have stated very clearly that you will not go to rehab. you did agree to have a visiting nurse come in and help you from time to time. we think this will be very helpful in managing your medications, monitoring your copd/chf, and making sure the wound on your r leg is healing properly. when you leave the hospital, it is important for you to take your medications as directed. you will follow up with your pcp, ___ week. all our best, your ___ care team followup instructions: ___ "

clots on warfarin iso non-adherence, dvt/pe with thrombosed, irretrievable ivc filter, history of heroin abuse, recent admission for chest pain/dyspnea attributed to copd exacerbation who re-presented after discharge on ___nd a bleeding laceration on his right lower extremity. he quickly stabilized. the medical team continually encouraged the patient to participate in ___ and consider rehab at discharge. he was not amenable to rehab placement but did accept home with ___ services. # chronic ___ edema, skin ulcerations: the patient presented with numerous skin ulcerations on his bilateral lower extremities, and a bleeding laceration on his left lower extremity. there was no evidence of infection on exam. the wound care team managed his lower extremity ulcerations. the chronic venous stasis changes are thought to be secondary to decreased blood return to the right side of the heart from the completely clotted ivc filter. unfortunately, the vascular team evaluated the patient on previous admissions, and they determined that they cannot remove the filter because there is entirely too much clot burden around the filter. # falls: the patient reported frequent falls while at home prior to admission. the etiology of the falls is most likely mechanical. contributing factors were thought to be polypharmacy (high dose opiates, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, etc.) vs. orthostasis as patient presented with markedly decreased po intake and downtrending h/h. patient denied loc, but admitted that he did not entirely remember all of the details. ct head and c-spine were negative for evidence of injury. cxr was without rib fracture. the medical team brought up the topic of decreasing his sedating medicine, and the patient was not amenable to that plan. the medical team continually encouraged the patient to participate in ___ and consider rehab at discharge. he was not amenable to rehab placement but did accept home with ___ services. # ___ on ckd/acute urinary retention: his creatinine on admission was 1.9. this was thought to be pre-renal (secondary to poor po intake and anemia) vs. post-renal (as patient found to be retaining 1l of urine upon arrival to the floor). his ___ improved with iv fluids. his urinary retention was most likely a medication side effect. renal u/s showed no sign of hydronephrosis. ua and urine culture were unremarkable. # acute on chronic anemia: patient with waxing and waning h/h throughout other prior admissions without clear etiology. iron studies from previous hospitalizations were normal, reticulocyte count suggestive of hypoproliferation. this was most likely a combination of chronic disease/iron deficiency/blood loss from oozing leg wounds. during the hospitalization, he also had two episodes of brisk bleeding from his lower extremities, which was controlled with pressure dressings. the patient received a total of 3u prbcs during this hospitalization with appropriate response in hemoglobin after the transfusion. # constipation: patient endorsed a several day hx prior to admission w/o bm, most likely secondary to opiate use. this is a chronic issue that he says has been present since he was a teenager. he said he has bowel movements every ___ weeks. he was continued on home senna, docusate, lactulose bid, bisacodyl suppository prn. chronic issues ============== # chronic diastolic heart failure: the patient presented without evidence of volume overload on exam (other than chronic ___ edema), bnp below recent baseline and cxr without edema. last discharge weight 104.3kg, current weight stable. he was continued on home torsemide and a 2g salt restricted diet. # cad: he was continued on home metoprolol and aspirin. # chronic pain/polysubstance abuse: he was continued on home methadone, gabapentin, clonazepam, and oxycontin. # copd: on ___ at home intermittently. the patient was at baseline o2 saturation and o2 requirement. he was continued on home ipratroptium and albuterol nebulizers prn. #goals of care: multiple conversations were attempted with the patient to explain that his chronic lower extremity bleeding would continue for the rest of his life because of his clotted ivc filter that cannot be removed. it seemed that he was not able to grasp that concept, even after multiple attempts. # hepatitis c: no history of treatment, no cirrhosis on prior imaging but history of hepatic encephalopathy # history of pulmonary embolism: he was continued on home warfarin. # depression/post-traumatic stress disorder: he was continued on home duloxetine and clonazepam. # bph: he was continued on home tamsulosin. transitional issues ================= - a further goals of care discussion would be very beneficial for the patient. he seems to have very poor insight into his condition. - continue pressure dressings on his lower extremities given venous congestion in lower extremities and higher propensity to bleed. # code status: full # contact next of kin: ___ ___

instructions: dear mr. ___, you were hospitalized at ___. why were you here? =============== - you were admitted to the hospital because you had multiple falls at home. what did we do for you? ================= - we did quite a bit of testing and believe that your fall was most likely due to weakness in your legs. - we had you work with physical therapy while you were in the hospital, and they made the determination that you should go to rehab after discharge. - we believe rehab is very important in you being able to recover enough strength to take care of yourself in your own home. - you chose to go home instead with nursing services to help care for your chronic conditions, wounds, medication management. - you were also found to have a low blood count and had some wounds in your legs that were bleeding. your blood count dropped low enough that you required blood transfusions. what do you need to do? ================== - your blood count will need to be checked as an outpatient to make sure it stays at a safe level. - when you are discharged, it is important to take all of your medications as directed. - you will be discharged to home and will follow up with your pcp. all our best, your ___ care team followup instructions: ___ "

medicine where iv levofloxacin was initially added. rle extremity noted to have severe chronic stasis dermatitis with emacirated bleeding skin erosions. ct of rle was obtained which did not show any evidence soft tissue infection or abscess. ct head was non acute and cxr was noted for stable cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion. admitted to the floor and started on empiric abx with ceftriaxone, flagyl and vanco. did not have any more fever spikes. started weaning off abx on ___ by stopping flagyl and ceftriaxone. dermatology was consulted and felt that his skin lesions were c/w acroangiodermatitis related to his venous stasis; the mainstay of treatment is compression with which the patient has initially not been amenable to. on ___, pt triggered for hypotension with hct drop down to 17.2 and transferred to the ficu where he received prbc x7. hemolysis labs were negative as were stool guiacs and his hct eventually stabilized. the only known source of bleeding was his leg which had somewhat increased bleeding that morning in the setting of therputic sq lovenox. he did not undergo any further evaluation for occult bleed. lovenox was held. given his hypotension and some

initially on iv vanco + levofloxacin, switched to iv ceftriaxone + po mtronidazole subsequently as bcx ntd and afebrile stopped iv ceftriaxone + flagyl (last doses ___ and continued iv vanco. iv vanco held on ___ after completion of 8 day course. no further abx given blood cultures were negative and fevers never recurred. the suspicion for cellulitis in his leg was low from the outset - acute on chronic blood loss anemia: requiring 7 blood transfusions on ___. likely ___ to blood loss from bleeding rle wounds. ct abd/pelvis non-con ___ did not show any other obvious site of bleeding. however does report some brbpr and very likely to have colonic varrices/hemmoroids. the degree of anemia and prbc requirement (10 units thus far during this admission) suggested that beyond his legs wound there may be another ongoing source of slow blood loss which is most likely to be in his lower gi tract. he was reviewed by gastroenterology consult who ultimately decided to do egd/colonoscopy. due to the large fecal load, he required several days of preparation. the egd showed signs of linear erosion with oozing (endoclipped) - and gastritis. colonoscopy was unremarkable although could not reach cecum. a ctc virtual colonography revealed no suspicious lesions. for this bleed, mr. ___ was placed on ppi bid. hpylori serologies and stool ag were pending on dc but treatment is recommended if serology is positive. - severe macerated stasis dermatitis of lower extremities: bleeding skin lesions c/w acroangiodermatitis related to his venous stasis. warfarin and sq lovenox continue to be held given ongoing bleeding. sq heparin was trialed and caused significantly worsened bleeding and was held again on ___ with subsequent improvement. he was reviewed by dermatology and per their recs underwent intensive wound care with vaseline impregnated gauze or adaptic covered by absorptive dressing covered by kerlix as well as compressive ace raps and elevation for bilateral lower extremities. compression is considered to be the mainstay of treatment for his underlying skin condition. - chronic vte/thrombosis/embolism risk: discussed with hematology consult and vascular surgery given his high risk of dvt and embolism in the setting of holding of anticoagulation and an in-situ old ivc filter which is likely not protecting him from pe anymore and can even serve as a nidus for a down stream clot. per vascular there are no available surgical interventions for his venous stasis and the ivc filter can not be safely removed. hematology team agreed that anticoagulation be held initially. after the gastric bleed was identified and treated, mr. ___ was placed back on anticoagulation with heparin gtt sliding scale. he was stable for >48hrs on iv heparin and warfarin was resumed with goal inr ___. on discharge he is to be transitioned to lovenox ___ q12 as a bridge to warfarin until inr >2. please given lovenox upon arrival to the facility and dose from there. please check inr again on ___. - hypotension: likely ___ to fluid shifts and unstable intravascular volume due to bleeding and torsamide. these responded to fluid boluses and prbc transfusion and resolved with holding of home torsamide and anticoagulation. his torsemide was resumed on dc but his lisinopril continues to be held. this can be re-evaluated in the future - constipation: managed with agresive bowl regimen and enemas. - ___. bland ua except for elevated sg. resolved with ivf - elevated lactate, low bp's, ___: ? low circulating volume in the setting of sirs. resolved - mild pulmonary congestion and hypoxia in the setting of being off his home torsamide. resolved. - long standing pancytopenia: b12, folate, ferritin checked during this admission and not low. - known splenomegaly: no obvious cirrhosis on . abdominal ct ___ showed splenomegaly. liver was unremarkable. stable - h/o recurrent falls and poor functional status - chronic pain syndrome/opiates: on mmt for years, but it appears that ___ rehab is tapering him down; his dose was 60 mg daily which he tolerated well per rehab nursing and records. until ___, the patient was on oxycontin 40 mg tid for his chronic pain. it appears that this has been stopped at some point during his recent hospitalizations and rehab stays. has not visited his ___ clinic since ___. during this admission he was ultimately placed on methadone 85 mg day for his aute on chronic pain (leg and abdomen). no additional opiates are needed otherwise at this baseline. - his methadone is currently for chronic pain at the dose recommended. can wean as tolerated - social issues: until recently, the patient has lived alone where he is somewhat unsafe and often falls. he has frequent hospitalizations, partially caused by failures of self-care for his multiple chronic illnesses. however, he has fairly bad ptsd and an independent spirit, so he likes being left alone and usually refuses any rehab placements or skilled home care. recently he has been in ___ rehab. patient has previously declined to complete an hcp as he has no friends or relatives involved in his care. chronic: -ptsd - cad s/p stemi (w/bms in lad

methadone, anxiety, admitted ___ with leg pain and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia, now status post course of antibiotics with resolution of respiratory symptoms, spontaneous improvement in leg pain without evidence of new acute pathology, able to be discharged home with services. # acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to acute bacterial pneumonia # copd patient initially was admitted for leg pain management, but found to be febrile on admission to the floor. initial source of fever was unclear as ct torso was without evidence of infection, but subsequent chest xray subsequently demonstrated a developing pneumonia. patient initially on unasyn for broad coverage given subsequent persistent fever and progressive hypoxia with intermittent blood streaked sputum (thought to be from pneumonia and anticoagulation as admission chest imaging did not show other potential causes). antibiotics were transitioned to vancomycin and levaquin, with subsequent slow improvement in respiratory status over several days. slow improvement felt to relate to his significant underlying lung disease. he was able to be weaned to home ra to 2lnc and completed an 8 day course of levofloxacin. would repeat chest ct in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of pneumonia--could consider repeating sooner if hemoptysis were to persist. continued tiotropium, nebulizers. patient frequently declined bronchodilators during this admission, occasionally resulting in episodes of hypoxia that would then resolve with use of a bronchodilator. # r leg pain # chronic r lower extremity dvt presented for worsening bilateral leg pain. patient was evaluated by vascular surgery while in the emergency department who noted no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the imaged portion of the right or left lower extremity veins based on ultrasound of the lower extremities. remainder of workup did not reveal fracture or other serious acute process. pain improved with home pain medications and patient was able to ambulate at time of discharge. # ___ on ckd stage 3 cr peaked at 1.6 following admission for above acute processes; improved with holding home diuresis; restarted home diuresis without issue; # home situation / social supports of note patient was evaluated by ___ who recommended discharge to rehab, however patient adamantly refused to go to rehab. there was concern about sending patient home because he often refuses services and often refuses help. team and psychiatry evaluated patient; no inpatient mental health needs and patient was able to demonstrate understanding of risks of discharge home plan; he verbally contracted to allow home services into his home. social work contacted patient's landlord as well as elder services to ensure safe plan in place, in addition to work by case manager to optimize home services. overall, team's impression was of a patient with history of poor decisions with respect to health and self-care, as well as a difficult personality, but of a person who had capacity to make these decisions. at future outpatient and/or inpatient visits would continue to have ongoing dialogue about safest home situation with periodic reassessments to ensure he maintains the capacity to make these decisions. # acute metabolic encephalopathy # chronic pain # opioid use disorder # anxiety hospital course was initially notable for patient's somnolence which was felt to be a result of methadone, gabapentin and clonazepam use in setting of his acute illness and ___. during this time, gabapentin and clonazepam were reduced with subsequent improvement in mental status. they were subsequently able to be returned to home dosing. continued patient's methadone, although patient frequently requested dose increases, reporting

=================================== - discharged home with services - as above, would consider ongoing dialog re: safest living situation for him, as well as have periodic assessments of his capacity to make these decisions. - would consider repeat upep within ___ weeks of discharge - warfarin was dosed 2.5mg with goal inr of ___. continue outpatient inr management - would consider repeat ct chest at ___ weeks to ensure resolution of consolidation - given potential for respiratory depression and black box warning re: coadministration, would consider weaning/downtitration of opiate and benzodiazepine regimen as outpatient; additionally, as per psychiatry consultation, given that patient reports issues related to methadone cravings and withdrawal, referral of patient to a ___ clinic

chronic pain on methadone, chronic bilateral leg swelling who initially p/w diarrhea, which has since resolved. found to have an lv thrombus of unclear chronicity on imaging and is now s/p lovenox bridge to coumadin. his course was complicated by acute hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring ficu transfer for bipap on ___, as well as intermittent encephalopathy. # acute on chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure # central hypoventilation due to sedating medications # moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension # concern for osa # copd suspect acute hypoxia on ___ was due to a combination of central hypoventilation from home methadone/klonopin/gabapentin with possible aspiration and copd exacerbation given wheezing and productive cough. pt required brief icu stay and was started on nocturnal bipap. tte this admission showed interval worsening of phtn with now moderate phtn and worsening tr and mr, which is also likely contributing to his hypoxia and made worse by possible underlying central hypoventilation. at baseline, pt at 2l nocturnal o2. while pt has been intermittently refusing his torsemide, he does not have significant evidence of pulmonary edema on cxr with lower bnp than prior and his hypoxia has actually improved. this makes chf exacerbation less likely. s/p doxy for copd flare. initiated taper of patient's multiple sedating medications. he will need a formal sleep evaluation following discharge. he will also need outpatient follow up for recent tte findings with worsening pah/mr/tr. prior to discharge his clonazepam dose was reduced to 1 mg 3 times daily. on the day of discharge the patient was not in respiratory distress and he was satting well on room air. # acute encephalopathy: pt with acute obtundation ___, about ___ hours after receiving multiple sedating medications. mental status improved with transient bipap and no other intervention. suspect the most likely cause of obtundation is his multiple sedating medications and long term tapering is crucial to optimize both his mental and respiratory status. delirium secondary to hospitalization and medications also likely contributing. mental status improved to baseline prior to discharge. the patient insistent to go home on several occations. we explained that we had serious reservations about the safety of going home given his deconditioning and multiple sedating medications. while he disagreed with us about the severity of the risks of being discharged home, he does express a clear understanding of the risks and of our degree of concern. he is able to provide a cogent plan for what he will do after being discharged, knew that he needed a chair car to get home, reports access to money/food/shelter, and has close friends that he is planning on staying with (he declined to provide me with their contact information). we further discussed his elevated inr, and he understood this and the risks associated with it, and was able to articulate how his warfarin/inr is managed at home and that he needed to look out for signs of bleeding without being prompted. this suggests to us that he does understand fairly complex medical issues and decisions. given all of this, and the psychiatric evaluation on ___ with similar conclusions, we believe he does have the capacity to leave the hospital at this time. he has pcp follow up the on ___ which he is aware of and plans to follow through with. he stated he was able to call his home ___ services to have the re-established after his discharge. we will also contacted them in the morning. he was able to get out of bed and ambulate using a cane with the rn this afternoon prior to discharge. # lv thrombus # h/o dvt/pe # clotted ivc filter patient with history of clotted filter since at least ___. previously evaluated by vascular surgery who determined there was no way to remove filter. cta showing chronic lv apical thrombus. tte was suboptimal but did not show thrombus. the patient follows with hca acms but seems to be non-compliant with inr checks. tte with suboptimal quality though did not show any lv thrombus. given subtherapeutic inr on presentation, he was treated with lovenox bridge. however his inr was supratherapeutic prior to discharge and warfarin was held. on the day of discharge the patient declined blood tests and we were not able to measure his inr on discharge or make warfarin adjustments. patient should follow-up with outpatient anticoagulation provider for further titration of his warfarin dose. # cad # chronic systolic heart failure patient reports that he is not taking his torsemide as it makes him urinate. despite this, he appeared euvolemic on exam, and bnp, while elevated, was improved from prior values. pt endorsed chronic heaviness in his chest; but serial cardiac enzymes and ecg's were reassuring with only non-specific t wave changes on ecg during trigger on ___ pm. # chronic pain / anxiety: patient on high dose methadone, gabapentin and clonazepam at home. doses confirmed in omr and ___ (last filled scripts on ___. gabapentin and clonazepam doses have been down titrated during this admission. # multiple falls # goals of care on previous admissions there has been concern that he is not safe at home and ___ has recommended rehab which he refuses. pcp has also been addressing alternative living situations with the patient including ___ house. pt has capacity to decline rehab option (see above) and therefore based on his wishes he was discharged home with ___ services. # passive si: pt reportedly expressed a desire \"to end it all\" early in hospitalization and would not further elaborate. psych consulted, felt this did not represent true si after discussion with pt (see psych consult note for details). found no psychiatric contraindication to discharge. could consider outpatient neuropsych evaluation. # diarrhea: resolved, with subsequent complaints of constipation. # chronic systolic heart failure ef 50% on tte this admission. patient complained of dyspnea on exertion and reports that he is not taking his torsemide as it makes him urinate. despite this, he appeared euvolemic on exam, and bnp, while elevated, was improved from prior values. he continued to refuse his torsemide intermittently while inpatient but resrtarted prior to discharge. # copd: patient reports he uses o2 at home at

ulcers (on coumadin), occluded ivc filter (since ___, opioid dependence on methadone who presented with diarrhea and abdominal pain. he was not a great historian, although he claimed leg pain was the chief complaint on arrival, he then said he was here for abdominal pain and diarrhea. #abdominal pain and diarrhea, watery, chronic -checked c diff but it was cancelled by lab because a formed stool was sent. his diarrhea improved since multivitamins were started for him (question if it was nutritional deficiency related diarrhea). -obtained cta abdomen/pelvis which was unremarkable. his

he was not placed on this chronically, it was inappropriate to initiate chronic narcotics in the hospital for a chronic condition. therefore, this was discontinued. he was given tylenol and encouraged

report any pain in his shoulder, just his arm. given that his rom was limited to pain so he would not comply with exam, and the fact that he said there was no acute change in over 4 weeks, he did not need to have an urgent inpatient mri. he was instructed to f/u with his outpatient orthopedist so they can compare function now from when he came in previously. #persistent left arm pain -obtained ct

involving the visualized right internal jugular vein, right sigmoid/transverse sinuses and length of the superior sagittal sinus. this correlates with the findings from the outside hospital mri. in addition, there are prominent tubular gradient echo susceptibility foci of the bilateral vertex and left parieto-occipital lobes, compatible with cortical vein thrombosis. 2. diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement has been reported in the setting of dural venous thrombosis. the finding is nonspecific and may be seen in settings ranging from meningitis to intracranial hypotension (please note, the current study demonstrates no findings to suggest intracranial hypotension). 3. there is posterior leptomeningeal enhancement most conspicuously involving the right temporoparietal and left parieto-occipital lobes with associated t2/flair sulcal hyperintensity. these could represent venous collaterals with slow flow. infectious etiology is not entirely excluded on imaging basis and
